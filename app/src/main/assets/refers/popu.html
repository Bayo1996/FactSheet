<p>Kenya has severe, generalized HIV epidemic, but in recent years, the country has experienced a notable decline in HIV prevalence, attributed in part to significant behavioral change and increased access to ART (antiretroviral drugs).</p> 
<p><b>Adult</b> HIV prevalence is estimated to have fallen from 10 percent in the late 1990s to about 6.1 percent in 2005.</p>
<p><b> Women</b> face considerably higher risk of HIV infection than men, and also experience a shorter life expectancy due to HIV/AIDS.</p>
<p> The 7th edition of AIDS in Kenya reports an HIV prevalence rate of eight percent in adult women and four percent in adult men. </p>
<p>Populations in Kenya especially at risk include injecting drug users and people in prostitution, whose prevalence rates are estimated at 53 percent and 27 percent, respectively.</p>
<p><b> Men who have sex with men</b> (MSM) are also at risk at a prevalence of 18.2%.</p>
<p> Other groups also include <b>discordant couples</b> (where one partner is infected and the other is not),<b> prison communities, uniformed forces, and truck drivers.</b></p>

<h4><b>KP RISKS VULNERABILITIES</b></h4>

<p><b>UNAIDS</b> defines “risk” as <b>“the probability that a person may acquire HIV infection,”</b> usually as a result of specific behavior s that allow HIV transmission to occur (UNAIDS, 2007).</p> 
 <p>By contrast, an individual is <b>“vulnerable”</b> to HIV when his or her ability to avoid infection is diminished by one or more other factors, such as lack of personal knowledge or skills, the influence of cultural norms that validate <b>risky behaviors, or physical surroundings</b> that make risk reduction difficult or impossible (<b>UNAIDS, 2007; see Bates et al., 2004</b>).</p>
<p>Fully comprehending the HIV-related risks and vulnerabilities of many key populations is challenging.</p>
<p>  For many key populations – such as sex workers, men who have sex with men, and people who inject drugs – there is no clear understanding of the size and distribution of these groups.</p>

<p>Moreover, as these groups are socially marginalized and subject to criminal penalties for engaging in the behaviours that define them for epidemiological purposes, it has often been difficult to conduct relevant studies to quantify HIV prevalence or identify key factors associated with increased risk of infection.</p>







<h4><b>Key Populations Interventions</b></h4>

<p>The HIV/STI Package of Services for MARPs and their sex partners has <b>3 components:</b></p>
<ol>
<li><b>Behavioral Components</b></li>
<P>These are a range of sexual behavior change communication programs that use various communication channels (<b>mass media, community level or inter personal</b>) to disseminate behavioral messages designed to encourage people to reduce behaviors that increase risk of HIV and increase protective behaviors (reduction in multiple partnerships, correct and consistent condom use).</P>
<p>Behavioral interventions are also aimed to increase acceptability and demand for biomedical interventions</p>
<li><b>Biomedical components</b></li>
<p> – These directly influence the biological systems through which the virus infects a new host such as blocking infection (e.g., male and female condoms), decreasing infectiousness, anti-retroviral therapy (<b>ART</b>) as prevention) and reducing acquisition/infection risk (e.g., voluntary medical male circumcision).</p>
<li><b>Structural Components</b></li>
<p> – These are interventions that aim to address and changes root causes or structures like social, economic, political and environmental factors that determine or affect individual or community’s HIV risk and vulnerability in specific context.</p>
<p> These interventions attempt to reduce an individual’s HIV related vulnerability by creating the conditions in which people can adopt safe behaviors (and fulfill their human rights).</p>
<p> Structural approaches are part of overall HIV prevention strategy and must be complemented by other prevention options (Merson MH, Lancet, 2008).</p>

<p><b>LGBT rights</b> in Kenya are limited in comparison to other jurisdictions in the world.</p>
<p> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodomy" target="_blank">Sodomy</a> is a felony per Section 162 of the Kenyan Penal Code, punishable by 14 years imprisonment, and any sexual practices between males (termed <b>"gross indecency"</b>) are a felony under section 165 of the same statute, punishable by 5 years imprisonment.</p>
<p> The state does not recognize any relationships between persons of the same sex; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-sex_marriage" target="_blank">same-sex marriage</a>  is banned under the Kenyan Constitution.</p>
<p> There are no explicit protections against discrimination on the basis of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_orientation" target="_blank">sexual orientation</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_identity" target="_blank">gender identity</a>.</p>
<p> Adoption is prohibited to homosexual people.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transgender" target="_blank">Transgender</a> people have historically suffered discrimination, and there are no statutory provisions relating to transgender rights.</p>
<p> However, there have been a series of court rulings in favour of transgender rights, such as the right to change the names appearing on legal documents. It is currently unclear as to whether these rulings constitute substantive law on the issue of changing legal gender.</p></li>

<li><p>Kenyan society is highly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_conservatism" target="_blank">conservative</a>, and a large majority of people hold negative views of LGBT people.</p>
 <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homosexuality" target="_blank">Homosexuality</a> is "largely considered to be taboo and repugnant to [the] cultural values and morality" of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenya" target="_blank"> Kenya</a> .[2]</p>
 <p> Despite this, various organizations are working to protect and improve LGBT rights.[3]</p>
