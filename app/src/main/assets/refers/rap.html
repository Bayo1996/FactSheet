      <h4><b>Definitions</b></h4>
       <h4><b>Boyfriend/Girlfriend</b></h4>
       <p>A boyfriend/girlfriend is a term that is typically used to describe a relationship with a close friend of the opposite sex when romantic feelings are involved</p>
       <h4><b>PARTNERS</b></h4>
       <p>Partner is another word for a boyfriend or a girlfriend. This term is often used to describe someone who is in a serious, committed relationship. </p>
       <h4><b>Romantic Relationships</b></h4>
       <p>A romantic relationship is a relationship with someone from the opposite sex to whom you have emotional attraction.</p>
       <h4><b>Is it normal to feel attracted to a boy or a girl of the opposite sex?</b></h4>
       <p>Because you are young, it’s good to develop your relationship in a healthy manner. A healthy relationship with a person of the opposite sex includes being open with one another and building trust with one another. It’s important to talk about important things that you would wish to happen in your lives and set priorities for what you would wish to achieve. Remember to:
       <ul>
       <li>Be open to one another </li>
       <li>Take care of one another.</li>
       </ul>
       </p>
       <h4><b>What do I do when I feel like I want to kiss and hug someone from the opposite sex?</b></h4>
       <p>It’s important to understand that attraction hormones develop while you are an adolescent. Sometimes, relationships with people from the opposite sex can increase in intensity and you may trust the person enough to engage in sexual behaviors. You may feel confused what to do when you feel you would wish to explore sex and intimate actions such as kissing and hugging with someone else. Although it can be difficult, it’s very important not to have sex until you are married and old enough to take responsibility for the outcome of sex.</p>
       <h4><b>You can consider the following strategies to help you with sexual temptations:</b></h4>
       <p><p>Always plan to meet with your boyfriend/girlfriend in an open place, or at a place where there are other people</p> <p>Engage in activities that help you physically, emotionally and socially such as sports, hiking, camping, mental exercises like puzzles.</p><p> Avoid watching movies or programs that are of adult nature or that make you excited sexually.</p><p> Avoid listening to friends who advise you to have sex before marriage.</p><p> When you have questions about your relationship, ask for advice from your parents or any other close older person who loves you</p> </p>
       <h4><b>Romantic Relationship Considerations</b></h4>
       <p>When you are in a romantic relationship with someone, you should consider the following three factors before engaging in sexual intercourse or other sexual behaviors. Please see our pamphlet on Sexual Intercourse and talk to your counselor for more information about sex.
        </p>
      <h4><b>Abstinence in Your Relationship</b></h4>
      <p>Abstinence means restraining from participating in sexual behaviors. You are in charge of your own actions, so you can set a goal to not engage in sexual acts with other people, or practice abstinence. By practicing abstinence, you greatly reduce your chances of contracting a sexually transmitted infection.</p>
       <h4><b>Protection in Your Relationship</b></h4>
       <p>If you and your partner have made the decision to engage in sexual acts, please use protection such as condoms. Condoms can help protect not only you, but also your partner, from sexually transmitted infections and unplanned pregnancy. It is important not only to protect yourself from such infections from sex, but also that you protect your partner from such infections. </p>
       <h4><b>Faithfulness in Your Relationship</b></h4>
       <p>If you and your partner have engaged in sexual acts, you should discuss being faithful to one another and not having multiple sexual partners at one time. If you have multiple sexual partners at one time and you do not use protection, you could endanger yourself and your partners with sexually transmitted infections or unwanted pregnancies. Remaining faithful to one partner reduces the likelihood of getting a sexually transmitted infection. Faithfulness also strengthens the relationship you have with your partner with trust and honesty. </p>
