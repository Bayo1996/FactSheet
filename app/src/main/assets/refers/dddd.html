  <p>The real benefit of disclosing to a date or to a casual or anonymous sex partner may be a personal one.</p>
  <p> It takes strength of character to be honest in such a circumstance. At the same time, telling someone you are HIV positive at the beginning of a possible relationship or before having sex puts you in a vulnerable position.</p>
  <P> It's never easy to predict if you'll receive a positive or negative response.</p>
  <p>Despite the fact that most people know about safe sex and how the virus is transmitted, fear and stigma are still a reality in relation to HIV, and disclosure can stir up very strong emotions.</p>
  <p> Your status may deter some people from proceeding further in a relationship with you.</p>
  </p>
<h6><b>General dating and sexual partner disclosure issues to consider:</b></h6>
<ul>
  <li>Keep what you say as simple and as direct as possible.</li>
   <li>Give yourself credit if you have been practicing safer sex with the sexual partner you're disclosing your status to. You are already behaving responsibly with that person.</li>
   <li>If the person you're disclosing to reacts negatively, remember that's only one person. Not everyone is going to react the same way.</li>
   <li><b>Remember</b> that you should give the person you're disclosing your status to some time to process the information. Whatever their reaction may be at first, whether negative or positive, be aware that reactions can change in time.</li>
   </ul>
