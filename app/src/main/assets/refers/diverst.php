<h3><b>SEXUAL DIVERSITY</b></h3> 
<ol>
<li>First and foremost, we are all people. All of us have similarities and differences compared with others in our families, school, workplace, and communities. For example, there is wide variation in how we look and what we think, in our talents, and in our sexuality. This diversity of human experience exists everywhere.</li> 
<li>Variation in people’s sexual desires, behaviors, and identities is referred to as sexual diversity.</li> <li>People may experience feelings of love, attraction, and sexual desire for the other sex, the same sex, or both. This variation has always been true throughout history. It is true in all societies, whether or not the society accepts same-sex attraction.</li> 
<p>The term heterosexual is used to describe people who desire people of the other sex. The term homosexual is used to describe people who desire people of the same sex. In some settings these terms are preferred; in other settings other terms are used.</p>
<p>Like everyone else, transgender people (people whose gender identity differs from the sex they were assigned at birth) may be attracted to people of the same sex, the other sex, or both. </p>
<p>People may or may not identify as heterosexual, homosexual (gay or lesbian), or bisexual (attracted to people of both the same and the other sex).</p> 
<p>People may be labeled with a sexual identity that they do not claim for themselves. Some people do not want to be labeled or categorized in terms of their sexuality or sexual identity, regardless of their desires.</p> 
<p>What determines whether a person experiences desire for the same sex, the other sex, or both, is not well understood. These desires cannot be changed by religion, therapy, or medical intervention. A person’s desires, behavior, or identity may shift over time and from situation to situation.</p> 
<li>People who are heterosexual, homosexual, bisexual, or transgender may be found in every kind of family, community, religion, and profession. </li>
<li>As a matter of human rights, people may enter into relationships that they choose and that are consensual.</li> 
<li>In every society, individuals’ feelings about sexual diversity and homosexuality vary.</li> 
<p>Some people are comfortable with, and celebrate, sexual diversity. Others may experience fear or even hatred toward people who are homosexual. Some have mixed feelings. Fear of or aversion to homosexuals is called homophobia.</p>
<p>People’s feelings often reflect local norms. Such norms vary across a continuum that includes: stigma and discrimination<b> (for example, refusing someone housing or employment); rejection (for example, teasing); tolerance; acceptance; respect; and, finally, valuing and embracing diversity</b></p> 
<li><b>Unfortunately, rejection, stigma, and discrimination</b> toward people who desire or engage in same-sex experiences or relationships is widespread. Such stigma and discrimination harm people and violate their human rights. </li>
<p><b>Ridiculing</b> someone for being attracted to others of the same sex can cause that person to feel isolated or ashamed.</p>
<p>Where homosexuality is stigmatized, people who are attracted to others of the same sex may find it difficult or frightening to acknowledge their own sexual feelings or to be open with others about those feelings.</p>
<p>Some people identify publicly as heterosexual, even though they feel sexual desire mostly (or exclusively) for individuals of their own sex.</p>
 <p>Boys who do not act “masculine enough” may be intimidated into behaving in ways that are uncomfortable for the</p>
<li> All people should be able to participate in political, professional, and civic life without discrimination. Sexual norms should not present obstacles to such participation. </li>
<li> The shift toward acceptance of sexual diversity is gradually occurring in many parts of the world.</li> 
<p><b> Millions of people</b> — both homosexual and heterosexual — are working to support people’s right to choose their sex partners, and to form relationships based on mutual consent. </p>
<p>In secondary schools around the world, students have formed “gay–straight” alliances to oppose homophobia and to educate others about sexual diversity.</p> 
<p>Many human rights, civil rights, and public health institutions have issued declarations regarding the rights of all persons. These declarations support people’s right to choose their sex partners and to form relationships based on mutual consent.</p> 
<p>In some cases the media are also helping to generate changes in social attitudes and laws about sexual diversity. </p>
<p>Even in conservative settings where same-sex relationships have been taboo, people are finding ways to engage in respectful and compassionate discussions about this issue.</p> 
<li>Discrimination against a person based on that person’s sexual identity, desire, or consensual behavior is a violation of human rights.</li>
