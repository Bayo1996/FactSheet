<h4><b>Family</b></h4> 
<p>
 <p>If you have a good relationship with your family, disclosing to them may lead to an even stronger relationship.</p>
 <p> Your family is likely to be concerned about your future. You may find yourself educating them about HIV, as well as giving them emotional support.</p>
 <p> As they come to see that you're getting on with your life, and that your life is still good, their anxieties are likely to ease. 
 <p>Your family can be a good source of support depending on the nature of your relationship with them.</p>
  <p>Realistically, you also have to consider that if your relationship with your family has been less than ideal in the past, this news may further strain relations, at least for a while.</p>
 <p>HIV-positive parents face different and difficult decisions concerning disclosure to their children.</p>
 <p> These include important considerations of the prognosis of parental health and the matter of custody planning for underage children.</p>
 <p>Understanding the implications of HIV/AIDS may be beyond younger children. Decisions must be made about what and when to disclose.</p>
 </p>

<h4><b>Friends</b></h4>
<p>
 <p>Studies show that most people disclose their HIV diagnosis to close friends within days of learning the news themselves.</p>
 <p> Some people are more informed about HIV than others. A close friend may be able to offer new ways of thinking about your situation.</p>
 <p> A friend's greatest contribution may be simply listening to you.</p>
  <p>While most friends will respect that what you have revealed was told in confidence, you need to be aware that your HIV status may end up becoming the subject of gossip among your other friends and acquaintances.</p>
  <p> In this situation, as in other difficult times in life, some friendships will endure and even deepen while others will fade away.</p>
  <p> If you have a tight-knit family or social group, or you live in a small community or a rural area, confidentiality may be harder to maintain.</p>
  <p> You might consider discussing with a counselor or some trusted person outside of your regular life about how to proceed.</p></p>
