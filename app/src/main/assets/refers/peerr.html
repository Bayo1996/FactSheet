<h4><b>Counselling</b></h4>
<p>Is a person-to-person interaction, in which the peer provides adequate information to enable the client to understand his or her problem better in order to make an informed decision and act upon it.</p>
<h4><b>Value</b></h4>
<p>Is a belief that is important to an individual. Values can be influenced by religious, educational or cultural factors, as well as personal experiences.</p>
<h4><b>Attitude</b></h4>
<p>Is a view or opinion that is formed by values and beliefs <b>(self esteem, hope, faith, confidence).</b></p>


<h4><b>Interpersonal relationship</b></h4>
<p>Is the ability to get along with other people in order to achieve common goals.</p>
<p>The principle of interpersonal relationship is: “seek first to understand, then be understood.” Deeply understand the problem. Build the skills of empathetic listening on the basis of openness and trust.</p>
<p>There is an overlap between the two terms (values and attitudes) as someone’s personal attitudes or opinions may be based on the values that he or she holds. </p>

<p>The way we express our attitudes, feelings, biases and values will affect how well we counsel our clients. For example, if we are judgmental in our private reaction to the way the client looks, his or her social class, religion or cultural factors, counselling will not be effective</p>

<h4><b>Qualities of a good peer counselor</b></h4>

<h4><b>Counseling skills and techniques</b></h4>
   <p>There are many counseling skills that peer counselors need to apply during their practice to enable them be effective in helping their clients make informed choices.</p>
<h4><b>Note that young people are very sensitive</b></h4>
<ul>
    <li> Asking questions</li>
     <li> Showing empathy</li>
    <li> Clarifying, paraphrasing and reflecting</li>
    </ul>
  <h4><b>Counseling skills and techniques</b></h4>
   <h4><b>Active Listening</b></h4>
   <ul>
        <li>Listening is not the same as hearing. It is not a natural process, but rather requires energy, skill and commitment.</li>
        <li>Although listening is considered in many cultures to be passive and less important than speaking, active listening is a powerful tool because it can make the client feel important, acknowledged, and empowered.</li>
        </ul>
    <h4><b>Active listening can be improved by:</b></h4>
    <ul>
       <li>Maintaining eye contact</li>
       <li> Demonstrating interest</li>
       <li>Being attentive to the young person <b>(e.g., not doing other tasks at the same time and not interrupting)</b></li>
     </ul>

    <h4><b> Effective questioning skills</b></h4>
    <ul>
    <li>Open and closed ended questions are used to identify, clarify and break down the problem into component parts.</li>
    <li>Closed-ended questions may be suitable to determine the young person’s condition and medical history at the beginning of counseling.</li>
    <li>Closed-ended questions can be answered by yes, no, a number or a few words. They can be used at the beginning of counselling to break the ice, since they do not require the young person to reveal sensitive information or to share feelings. An example of a closed question is, <b>"How many girlfriends do you have?”</b></li>
    <li>Open-ended questions are useful for exploring the opinions and feeling of young people and usually require longer responses. These questions are more effective in determining their needs in terms of information and what they already know.</li>

    <li><b>Open-ended questions</b> have many possible  Answers. They can be used to learn about the client’s feelings, thoughts, knowledge and beliefs. An example is, <b>"How does your partner feel about condoms?” Asking question that begin with “why” may be intimidating or seem judgmental. It is preferable to use phrases such as, “What are your reasons for…?”</b></li>
    <li><b>Probing questions<b> helps the counselor to clarify the young person’s responses to open questions.  An example is, “Can you tell me how your friend’s experience has made you feel about abortion?”</b></b></li>
     <li><b>Leading questions</b>lead the respondent in a certain direction and are not desirable in counselling situations.“Isn’t it normal for boys to have wet dreams?”</li>
   </ul>
     <h4><b>Attending skills</b></h4>
     <p><b>SOLER </b>is an acronym used to describe the attending skills for the counsellor. Attending skills communicates to the clients that you are there for them.</p>
     <p>

S – Sit squarely<br>
O – Open posture<br>
L – Lean forward<br>
E – Eye contact<br>
R – Relax<br>
</b></p>

<h4><b>Reflection:</b></h4>
<p>Reflection is the echoing back of the last few words that the client has spoken.</p>
<h4><b>Challenging:</b></h4>
<p>Though challenging and confronting are not associated with counselling, there are times they are appropriate and even necessary.</p>
<h4><b>Paraphrasing</b></h4>
<p>The counsellor rephrases the content of the client’s message</p>


<h4><b>Purposes of Paraphrasing</b></h4>
<ul>
<li>To convey that you are understanding him/her</li>
<li>Help the client by simplifying, focusing and crystallizing what they said May encourage the client to elaborate</li>
<li>Provide a check on the accuracy of your perceptions</li>
</ul>
