	<h5><b>Young men and pregnancy</b></h5>
<p>Young men often receive blame but little information, counseling and support.</p>
<p> Young men may need help to accept and support the young woman’s right to decide the outcome of the pregnancy, and what her choice means for the father.</p>
<ul>
<li>They may need support to talk about their reaction to the pregnancy, how they feel about future involvement, dealing with family and friends’ responses.</li>
<li>	If the young woman decides to keep the baby it raises the question of what involvement the father wants and his legal responsibilities to help support his baby.</li>
<li>	If the father’s name is on the birth certificate, or if he is presumed to be the father (for example, because he and the young woman were living together), then he will be liable to help support the baby financially.</li>
<li>	If a young man does not believe he is the father, he would need to get legal advice. You can contact Legal Aid in your state or territory to find out more.</li>
<li><p>It is possible to have a DNA test to check if someone is the father of a particular baby.</p>
<p> This is done on blood (or other body tissues) from the man, the baby and preferably the mother as well.</p>
<p> The test can be done at any age and is now very accurate. He would need to talk with his doctor to find out how to do this.</p></li>
<li>	Many young men may need information about contraception.</li>
