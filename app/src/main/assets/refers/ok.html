       <h4><b>AMPATH Research Network,</b></h4>
      <p>IU School of Medicine research work in global health centers on the programs and initiatives of the AMPATH research network.</p>
      <p> Built on a strong partnership between Moi University and Indiana University School of Medicine, the Academic Model Providing Access to Healthcare (AMPATH) supports collaborative research involving investigators from more than 15 institutions in Africa, Europe and North America, including <b>Brown University, Duke University, University of Massachusetts, University of Notre Dame, Purdue University, University of Toronto and University of California, San Francisco.</b></p>
      <p>
      AMPATHâ€™s research network is dedicated to improving the health of the Kenyan people by enhancing the quality of patient care provided at AMPATH clinic sites and informing health policy in Kenya.</p>
      <p> Since 1998, this program has attracted more than $96.3 million in sponsor support and produced more than 450 peer-reviewed journal articles.</p>
      <p> While AMPATH research is supported by a diverse community of sponsors, more than 60 percent of total financial support comes from National Institutes of Health research and training grants. The network continues to lead the quest for insight to persistent public health issues globally.</p>
