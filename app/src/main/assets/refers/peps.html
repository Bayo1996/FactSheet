<p><b>Post-exposure prophylaxis , or PEP</b>, is a method of preventing HIV infection.</p>
<p> It involves using a short course of the drugs used to treat HIV, taken very soon after a person may have been exposed to the virus.</p>
<p>It is an emergency measure, rather than one to be used as a regular method of preventing HIV transmission.</p>
<h4><b>Purpose of PEP</b></h4>
<p><b>PEP</b> has been used for many years for healthcare workers who have had possible exposure to HIV;<br> for example, after accidentally pricking themselves with needles previously used on people who were known to have HIV or considered at high risk of having HIV.</p>
<p>PEP is not a <b>‘cure’</b> for HIV, PEP may prevent HIV from entering cells in the body and so stop someone from getting HIV.</p>
<h4><b>Timing of PEP</b></h4>
<p>To have the best chance of it being effective, you need to start taking PEP as soon as possible after the possible exposure to HIV.</p>
<p>It is best to start PEP within 24 hours, but certainly within 72 hours.</p>

<h4><b>Where to get PEP</b></h4>
<p>Go to a sexual health clinic, If they operate an appointments system and are fully booked, explain that it’s an emergency and that you need to be seen.</p>
<p> If your local sexual health clinic is not open (for example, at the weekend), go to an accident and emergency department at a hospital, where staff will contact an HIV specialist able to prescribe PEP.</p>
<h4><b>When is PEP recommended?</b></h4>
<ol>
<li><b>Receptive anal sex:</b> PEP is recommended if you have had receptive anal sex (when you are the 'bottom') with someone who is known to be HIV positive or who is thought to be from a high-prevalence country or risk group, e.g. from sub-Saharan Africa or a man who has sex with men (MSM).<br> The exception to this is if the person you had sex with is known to be on HIV treatment and to have an undetectable viral load.</li>
<li><b>Insertive anal sex:</b> PEP is recommended if you have had insertive anal sex (when you are the 'top') with someone who is known to be HIV positive, unless they have an undetectable viral load.</li>
<li><b>Vaginal sex:</b> PEP is recommended for women who have had vaginal sex with a man who is known to be HIV positive, unless he has an undetectable viral load.<br> It will be considered for men who have had vaginal sex with a woman who is known to be HIV positive, unless she has an undetectable viral load.</li>
<li><b>Non-sterile injection equipment:</b> PEP is recommended if you have used injecting equipment previously used by someone who is known to be HIV positive, unless they have an undetectable viral load.</li>
</ol>
<h4><b>Drugs used for PEP</b></h4>
<p>PEP normally consists of three anti-HIV drugs, from two of the different classes.</p>
<p>PEP should be taken for 28 days.<br> It is important to take all the doses, at the right time and in the right way, to give PEP the best chance of working.</p>
<p> You might be given an additional two days’ drugs if you have been at risk of exposure in the last 48 hours of the course of PEP.</p>
<h4><b>Side-effects</b></h4>
<p>HIV treatment can cause side-effects which tend to be worst when you first start taking them.</p><p> If you are taking PEP you could experience some unpleasant side-effects such as <b>feeling sick, being sick , diarrhoea , tiredness, and generally feeling unwell</b>.</p>
