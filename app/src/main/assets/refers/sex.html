        <h4><b>How did I get the HIV virus? </b></h4>
        <p>There are many ways a person can contract the HIV virus. Sometimes, children can contract the HIV virus from their mother during child birth. Other times, children can receive blood transfusions with the virus in the extra blood. HIV can also be transmitted through unprotected sexual intercourse. In the past, we did not have drugs to prevent the passing of the virus from mother to child and didn’t have appropriate tools to test blood before transfusions. You cannot change that you were infected with the HIV virus, but it is important to recognize how you can manage the HIV in your system. You can best manage the HIV virus by taking your medicines daily. You can prevent passing the virus to anyone else by taking your medicines, not engaging in unprotected sex, and taking care of any open wounds you may have. </p>
        <h4><b>How long do I need to take the medicines?</b></h4>
        <p>Sometimes, you may feel like taking medicines is cumbersome and difficult to swallow. You should continue to take your medicines daily as the doctor or clinical officer has prescribed to you. If you stop taking your medicines, your soldier cells may become weak and the virus can take over your body and make you very sick. By taking your medicines, your soldier cells stay strong and you won’t get sick!</p>
        <h4><b>What Does CD4 count mean?</b></h4>
        <p>The CD4 count is the number of healthy soldier cells you have in your blood. The more healthy soldier cells you have in your blood, the better you will feel!</p>
        <h4><b>Can this disease be cured?</b></h4>
        <p>Right now we do not have a way to cure this disease. We cannot kill it and remove it from the body. But the good news is that your medicines can control the virus, so the virus will not harm you. The medicines can keep the virus sleeping. HIV can be controlled by strictly taking medications and following doctor’s instructions. Researchers and doctors are working to find a cure for this disease, but right now there is no cure, anywhere in the world. When you hear that there is a cure, this is false information.  </p>
        <h4><b>How long will I live?</b></h4>
        <p>If you take your meds regularly, follow doctors’ instructions well and take good care of yourself —like eating good foods, getting good sleep, making healthy decisions and staying away from risky behaviors such as drug and alcohol use and unprotected sexual intercourse—you can grow up to be an adult, have a family, be healthy and achieve your dreams in life. </p>
        <h4><b>Am I dying?</b></h4>
        <p>People who have HIV will not die very soon if they take good care of themselves and take their medications regularly. They can still live normally and choose their own way to live. Many children who started taking ARV drugs in their childhood have lived positive lives and have attended schools, become doctors and nurses, have families, and accomplish many things in their adult lives. </p>
        <h4><b>Can I have a boyfriend/ girlfriend or get married one day?</b></h4>
        <p>Yes, you can have a boyfriend/girlfriend or get married when you are an adult and ready. The foundation of a couple’s life together is built on understanding and trusting each other. Both your health and your partner’s health should be discussed in a trusting and honest way. Your counselor can help you to prepare for talking about this with the person you choose</p>
         <h4><b>Should I tell a boyfriend/girlfriend that I have HIV? If so, when?</b></h4>
         <p>If you have a boyfriend or girlfriend, you should disclose your status when you feel you truly trust that person. This is a very careful decision and you should take your time. Refrain from engaging in any unprotected sexual behaviors until you have told the person. Remember, if you care about this person, you should help protect him or her and not transmit the virus. Focus on strengthening your relationship with trust and caring before you disclose your status or engage in adult behaviors. 
</p>
       <h4><b>Is it necessary that I should be boyfriend/girlfriend, or married, only with a HIV positive person?</b></h4>
       <p>If you have HIV and your partner does not, that is okay! But you need to use appropriate protection, so you do not transmit the virus to your partner. Please consider talking to a counselor or a doctor for appropriate advice in how to manage HIV and not transmit it to your partner. Your life as a couple will require understanding and safe practices; the doctor will give you good directions. </p>
       <h4><b>It’s okay to have  Questions!</b></h4>
       <p>Being diagnosed with HIV can be a scary experience, and you may find yourself asking many questions.  It is important to know that you are not alone and there are many people including your doctors and counselors to help you with your challenges.  In this pamphlet are some of the most frequent questions asked by adolescents who have recently learned they are HIV positive. </p>
