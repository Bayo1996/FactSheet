					<h4><b>What Is Nutrition?</b></h4>
         <p><b>Nutrition</b> refers to the food we eat to grow and stay healthy. Nutrition also includes all the processes our body uses to take in and use that food (<b>called metabolism</b>).</p>

        <h4><b>Why Is Good Nutrition Important for People Living With HIV?</b></h4>
         <p>Good nutrition supports overall health and helps maintain the immune system.</p>
        <p> Good nutrition also helps people with HIV maintain a healthy weight and absorb HIV medicines.</p>

  <h4><b>What Is a Healthy Diet for People Living With HIV?</b></h4>

<li>Eat the right amount of food to maintain a healthy weight.</li>
<li>Choose foods low in saturated fat (found in animal products such as meat and dairy products), sodium (salt), and added sugars.
</li></ul>
<h4><b>What Are Some Nutrition-Related Problems That People With HIV May Face?</b></h4>
