<p><b>CD4 cells</b> are white blood cells that play an important role in the immune system.</p>
<p> Your CD4 cell count gives you an indication of the health of your immune system – your body’s natural defence system against pathogens, infections and illnesses.</p>
<p>CD4 cells are sometimes also called <b>T-cells, T-lymphocytes, or helper cells</b>.</p>
<p><b>Your CD4 cell count</b> is the number of blood cells in a cubic millimetre of blood (a very small blood sample).</p>
<p> It is not a count of all the CD4 cells in your body.</p>
<p> A higher number indicates a stronger immune system.</p>
<p>The CD4 cell count of a person who does not have HIV can be anything between 500 and 1500</p>.
<p>People living with HIV who have a CD4 count over 500 are usually in pretty good health.</p>
<p>People living with HIV who have a CD4 cell count below 200 are at high risk of developing serious illnesses.</p> <p>HIV treatment is recommended for all people living with HIV. It is especially important for people with low CD4 counts.</p>
<p>If you have HIV and <b>do not take HIV treatment</b>, your CD4 count will fall over time.</p><p> The lower the CD4 cell count, the greater the damage to the immune system and the greater the risk of illness.</p>
<p>When you take HIV treatment, your CD4 count should gradually increase.</p>
