         <h4><b>How can you tell if someone is sick? </b></h4>
         <p>Sometimes, people can show signs of being sick through physical symptoms, like losing weight and becoming thin, rashes, or coughing. However, many times people may have an illness, but manage the illness with taking medications. With proper management of the illness, you may not be able to tell if a person is sick. </p>
       <h4><b>Why am I taking medicines if I am not physically sick? </b></h4>
       <p>Sometimes, we need to take medicines to keep our bodies healthy. You are prescribed pills even though you are not showing physical signs of sickness because there is still an illness or sickness in your body that could cause problems if you are not taking the medicines. Your body has soldier cells to help fight illnesses and keep your body healthy and strong. The pills prescribed to you help make your soldier cells strong. </p>
       <h4><b>Why am I taking medicines and my siblings are not taking medicines? </b></h4>
       <p>Each person’s body can react differently to illnesses. For instance, one of your siblings may develop a cough during the rainy season, but you don’t! Your siblings may not have to take pills every day because their soldier cells that fight off illness are already strong. You need to do what is right for your body alone. Since your body needs to have strong soldier cells, remember to take the pills to strengthen your soldier cells! </p>
       <h4><b>How Did I Get The HIV virus?</b></h4>
       <p>There are many ways a person can contract the HIV virus. Sometimes, children can contract the HIV virus from their mother during child birth. Other times, children can receive blood transfusions with the virus in the extra blood. HIV can also be transmitted through unprotected sexual intercourse. In the past, we did not have drugs to prevent the passing of the virus from mother to child and didn’t have appropriate tools to test blood before transfusions. You can best manage the HIV virus by taking your medicines daily. You will not transmit the virus to anyone else if you do not engage in unprotected sex, you take your medicines daily, and you take care of any open wounds you may have.</p>
        <h4><b>How long do I need to take the meds?</b></h4>
        <p>Sometimes, you may feel like taking medicines is cumbersome and difficult to swallow. You should continue to take your medicines, daily, as the doctor or clinical officer has prescribed to you. If you stop taking your medicines, your soldier cells may become weak and the virus can take over your body and make you very sick. By taking your medicines, your soldier cells stay strong and you won’t get sick! </p>

       <h4><b>What Does CD4 count mean?  </b></h4>
       <p>The CD4 count is the number of healthy soldier cells you have in your blood. The more healthy soldier cells you have in your blood, the better you will feel! </p>
       <h4><b>Can this disease be cured?</b></h4>
       <p>Right now we do not have way to cure this disease. We cannot kill it and remove it from the body. But the good news is that your medicines can control the virus, so the virus will not harm you. The medicines can keep the virus sleeping. HIV can be controlled by strictly taking medications and following doctor’s instructions. Researchers and doctors are working to find a cure for this disease, but right now there is no cure, anywhere in the world. When you hear that there is a cure, this is false information.  </p>
       <h4><b>How long will I live?</b></h4>
       <p>If you take your medicines regularly, follow doctors’ instructions well, and take good care of yourself (by eating good foods, getting good sleep, making healthy decisions and staying away from risky behaviors such as drugs, alcohol, and unprotected sexual intercourse), you can grow up to be an adult, be healthy, and achieve your dreams in life. </p>
        <h4><b>Am I dying?</b></h4>
        <p>People who have HIV will not die very soon if they take good care of themselves and take their medications regularly. They can still live normally and choose their own way to live. Many children who started taking ARV drugs in their childhood have lived positive lives and have attended schools, become doctors and nurses, have families, and accomplish many things in their adult lives. </p>
