<h4><b>Relationships with an HIV-negative partner</b></h4>
<p>Often, people living with HIV have partners who are HIV negative (these are sometimes referred to by healthcare professionals as <b>‘serodiscordant’</b> or <b>‘serodifferent’</b> relationships).</p>
<p> It can feel like relationships between people of different HIV status are sometimes thought of only in terms of sex and the risk of HIV transmission.</p>
<p>Sex is important to many intimate relationships –</p>
<p> but few relationships are based on sex alone in the longer term.</p>
<p> The sexual side of relationships may change significantly over time and its importance may vary for individuals in the relationship.</p>
<p>Having an undetectable HIV viral load, especially if you are on HIV treatment, makes you much less likely to pass on HIV.</p>
<p> Doctors now advise that, in the right circumstances, taking HIV treatment is as effective in preventing HIV as properly used condoms.</p>
<p>Another good way of preventing HIV transmission is to use condoms.</p>
<p> Used properly and consistently, they also prevent the transmission of other sexually transmitted infections, and can prevent unplanned pregnancies.</p>
<p>Using condoms well is a solution for some couples, but others find it difficult to use condoms all the time or at all, or choose not to.</p>
<p>You might resolve some problems with using condoms by talking to your partner about it.</p>
<p> You might also find it helpful to talk to someone at your clinic, such as a health adviser.</p>
<p>If you are concerned that there may have been a risk of HIV exposure (perhaps a condom has broken or come off), post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) is available.</p>
<p> If your partner is HIV negative, your clinic may be able to provide a starter pack of post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) for use if a condom breaks or comes off.</p>
<p>However, difficulties with using condoms are sometimes more connected to feelings about HIV, trust and intimacy, and talking through your feelings with your partner, or a professional such as a health adviser or counsellor might help in these situations.</p>
<p>If you are not practising safer sex, it’s important that you both understand and accept the possible risks and have considered the impact on both of you if your partner were to contract HIV.</p>
<p>Many people find it difficult to talk about sex, even with the person who is closest to them.</p>

<p>Sometimes, couples counselling can give you a chance to talk about difficult issues with your partner with the help of a trained counsellor.</p>
