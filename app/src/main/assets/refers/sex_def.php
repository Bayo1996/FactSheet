<h3><b>SEX AND SEXUALITY</b></h3>
<p><li><b>SEX</b> refers to one’s biological characteristics—anatomical (breasts, vagina, penis, testes), as a male or female. Sex is also a synonym for sexual intercourse, which includes penile-vaginal sex, oral sex, and anal sex.   
<b>Sexuality</b> is an expression of who we are as human beings. </p></li>
<li>Sexuality includes all the feelings, thoughts, and behaviors of being male or female, being attractive and being in love, as well as being in relationships that include intimacy and physical sexual activity.</p>  
<p>Sexuality begins before birth and lasts throughout the course of the life span.</p></li>
 A person’s sexuality is shaped by his or her <b>values, attitudes, behaviors, physical appearance, beliefs, emotions, personality, likes and dislikes, spiritual selves,</b> and all the ways in which he or she has been socialized. Consequently, the ways in which individuals express their sexuality are influenced by ethical, spiritual, cultural, and moral factors</p>
<p><b>Sensuality</b> – is how our bodies derive pleasure. It is the part of our body that deals with the five senses: touch, sight, hearing, smell, and taste. Any of these senses when enjoyed can be sensual. The sexual response cycle is also part of our sensuality because it is the mechanism that enables us to enjoy and respond to sexual pleasure.  
The word <b>SEX</b> is used to differentiate between male and female, therefore you hear of the <b>“male sex”</b> and the <b>“female sex”</b> or we speak of others of the <b>“opposite sex”.</b>
<li>The word sex is also used to refer to sexual activity or the act of sexual intercourse between persons’, therefore people talk about “having sex”.</p></li> 
<p>We are all created as sexual beings’, therefore it is important to understand <b>“Sexuality”.</b></p>  
<p>The word <b>SEXUALITY</b> describes characteristics and traits on the inside and outside of each individual, which determine how we present ourselves as male or female persons.</p>  
<p>These characteristics and traits include our tendencies, physical conditions, emotional states, preferences, urges and instincts – factors, which lead us to behave in certain ways.  In other words, how we look, feel and think make a difference to how we behave as sexual beings. Human Sexuality Human sexuality has at least four dimensions – biological, psychological, ethical and cultural.  The interrelationship of these dimensions results in an individual’s total sexuality.</p>
