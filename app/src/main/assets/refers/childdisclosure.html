<p>Giving your child information about HIV will be a process. What you say will depend on the <b>child’s age</b>, their level of understanding, and their readiness to know.</p>
<p>It’s important to think about how and when you’ll give your child information about either their own and/or your HIV infection.</p>
<p>It’s important that you use language your child will understand.</p>
<p> Be honest and consistent. Hiding the truth can mean that you will encounter problems later.</p>
<p><b>The healthcare team</b> – including the doctors, nurses and psychologist – at your child’s clinic will be able to help you talk to your child about HIV and illness.</p>
<p>Other parents and carers of children with HIV may also be able to share their experiences with you.</p>
<p> It’s a good idea to prepare yourself for possible reactions and have some support lined up to turn to if you need to.</p>
<p> Ask the team at your child’s clinic to recommend or refer you to HIV support organisations or peer support services, or see Where to go for information, help and support .</p>
<p> There are resources produced by the organisation Body & Soul to help parents and carers talk to children about HIV (see
<a href="http://bodyandsoulcharity.org/children/base-10-12-years/talking-to-our-children-about-hiv/#s1">http://bodyandsoulcharity.org/children/base-10-12-years/talking-to-our-children-about-hiv/#s1</a>).</p>
<p><b>Providing information as your child grows up</b></p>
<p>You’re likely to find that even very young children will want to know why they have to go to the clinic, have tests or take medicines.</p>
<p> You and your child’s healthcare team will have conversations about how and when HIV should be discussed openly with your child.</p>
<p>Most children are ready to have open conversations about HIV while they are at primary school.</p><p> Generally, they should know they have HIV by the time they go to secondary school.</p>
<p> The information you provide at this point should mention HIV.</p>
<p>Think about what you need to tell your child. They don’t need to have lots of detail about HIV or know all about the disease straightaway.</p>
<p> Giving too much information may only complicate things for them and make them confused and worried.</p>
<p>If your child starts asking questions about why they need to take medication or go to hospital, you should provide an explanation of why monitoring needs to happen and why treatment is important.</p> 
<p><b>For example:</b></p>
<ul>

<li>You were born with a virus in your blood called HIV.</li>
<li>You go to the clinic to see how HIV is affecting your health.</li>
<li>The medicines you take stop HIV from damaging your body and keep you well.</li>
</ul>
<p>Be prepared to answers questions.</p>
<p> <b>The questions you might be asked include:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>How did I get it?</li>
<li>How long will I live?</li>
<li>Am I going to die?</li>
<li>What will happen to me?</li>
<li>Do you have HIV as well?</li>
<li>How did you get HIV?</li>
<li>Can I give it to someone else?</li>
<li>Can I tell my friends I have it?</li>
<li>Will the HIV ever go away?</li>
</ul>

<p>You can probably think of lots of other questions that your child might ask.</p>
<p>You may be tempted to put off telling your child about HIV.</p>
<p> Young people who have been born with HIV have generally been told the name of their diagnosis by the time they start secondary school, though open conversations about HIV with children of a younger age are now recommended.</p>
<p> Children who find out later (when they are already in their teens,) can feel quite angry that important information about their body and their health was not shared with them, and this doesn’t help relationships with parents.</p>
