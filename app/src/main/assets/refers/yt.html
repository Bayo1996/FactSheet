 <h4><b>The Basics</b></h4>
 <p>People with HIV can engage in sexual intercourse. However, it is true that HIV can be passed from one person to another through sexual intercourse. Protection should be used to prevent transmission of HIV and to prevent contracting or spreading other sexually transmitted infections. If your partner is not ready for sex, then they have the right to refuse sexual acts. 
</p>
 <h4><b>Definitions</b></h4>
 <h4><b>Sexual Intercourse</b></h4>
 <p>Sexual intercourse is a physical act that involves close contact with genitals. Most often, people think of sexual intercourse as a male’s penis entering a female’s vagina. During this contact, vaginal fluids and semen are exchanged. These fluids can carry sexually transmitted infections (gonorrhea, chlamydia, genital warts, etc.) and the HIV virus. Other forms of sexual intercourse (listed below) can also result in sexually transmitted infections:
  <ul>
  <li><b>Oral Sex:</b> the sexual act of stimulating the genitalia of a partner with the mouth.</li>
  <li><b> Anal Sex:</b> the sexual act of inserting the male’s penis into the anus.</li>
  </ul>
  </p>
 <h4><b>What is a sexually transmitted infection?</b></h4>
 <p>A sexually transmitted infection is an infection that is passed from one person to another through sexual behaviors. Sexually transmitted infections can cause some physical symptoms such as rashes, boils, discharge from genitalia, or aches. These infections can also be “invisible” and not show any signs of infection. Protection during sexual behaviors, such as using condoms, can protect you from contracting such infections.</p>
 <h4><b>Human Sexual Response Cycle:</b></h4>
 <p>When humans are engaged in sexual activity, their body goes through several stages, called the Human Sexual Response Cycle:
 <ol>
 <li><b>Excitement:</b> Increase in heart rate and breathing</li>
 <li><b> Arousal:</b> genitals may swell. For males, the penis will become erect, and for females the genitals may become sensitive and lubricated.</li>
 <li><b>Plateau Phase:</b> Occurs right before orgasm.</li>
<li><b>Orgasmic Phase:</b> Contraction of lower pelvic muscles and a release of fluids from the genitals. Males release semen at this time, which is called ejaculation.</li>
<li><b>Resolution Phase:</b> Muscles begin to relax, the heart rate lowers, and the penis returns to a normal state of being flaccid and non-erect.</li>
</ol>
</p>
 <h4><b>Transmission</b></h4>
 <h4><b>What are the risks of having sex?</b></h4>
<p>Consequences of having sex may include:
<ul>
    <li>Pregnancy</li>
    <li> Sexually Transmitted infections</li>
    <li>Increase in HIV infection</li>
    <li> Dropping out of school</li>
    <li> Having a bad image</li>
</ul>
</p>
 <h4><b>Can I give someone else HIV? If so, how? </b></h4>
 <p>
     <p>If you have HIV, you can give your partner HIV through unprotected sexual intercourse.  This means you do not use a condom to prevent the exchange of fluids. The HIV virus is transmitted in bodily fluids.</p>
     <p>Take your medications according to your prescription regimen. By taking your medicines and remaining healthy, there is less HIV virus in your fluids and it will be less likely that you pass the virus to your partner.</p>
  </p>
 <h4><b>How do I know if my partner has a sexually transmitted infection? </b></h4>
     <p>Some sexually transmitted infections do not show any symptoms, so it is difficult to tell if people have infections. You can go to a clinic to get tested for sexually transmitted infections. If you have questions about where to get tested, please contact your counselor. <br>If you and your partner have not been tested, you should always use protection, such as condoms, to prevent transmission of “invisible” sexually transmitted infections. </p>
 <h4><b>Why do people use condoms?</b></h4>
      <p>Condoms are a tool used to protect yourself and your partner during sexual intercourse. A condom is usually made of rubber and is made to cover the male penis, preventing the transmission of fluids from one partner to the other during sexual intercourse.<br> Condoms must be used appropriately in order to be effective. If you are unsure of how to use a condom, please see your clinical officer or counselor at the clinic for an instruction.</p>
 <h4><b>When do you use a condom? </b></h4>
     <p>You should use a condom or make sure your partner puts on a condom, appropriately, before ANY contact with his or her genitals. The penis should be erect before applying the condom, to prevent any slippage of the condom.</p>
<h4><b>How do you use a condom?</b></h4>
      <p>*IMPORTANT: <b>The condom’s prevention of transmission of fluids is only successful if it is used appropriately. If there are any tears in the condom, then it is not going to prevent or block any fluids from your partner, and provides no protection.</b>
      <ol>
       <li>Inspect the condom wrapper to ensure there are no tears in either the condom or the condom wrapper, and that the condom is not expired.</li>
       <li> Open the condom by tearing the edge of the condom wrapper.</li>
       <li> Determine which way the condom is rolled.  This can be done easily by feeling with your fingers which way the condom unrolls. </li>
       <li> Pinch the reservoir tip so enough space is left at the tip of the penis and roll the condom with your forefinger and thumb down the shaft of the erect penis.</li>
       <li> During sexual intercourse, be keen on any rips or tears in the condom. If you notice a rip or tear, immediately withdraw the penis from your partner, remove the spoilt condom and put a new one on the penis.</li>
       <li>Immediately after ejaculation, withdraw the penis and remove the condom by grabbing the end of the condom, ensuring that the fluid inside does not spill out. To prevent the condom contents from spilling, you can tie a knot at the end of the condom before disposal into the trash.</li>
      </ol>  
   </p>
   <div class="col-md-12" style="background: grey; color: white;">
   <p>If you plan to have sex, always ensure your partner is willing to engage in sexual intercourse. You should only engage in sexual acts with someone you KNOW and TRUSTs. There are many emotions that are involved with sex and it is a topic and act that should not be taken lightly.
