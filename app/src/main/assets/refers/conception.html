<p>All women have the right to make their own choices around fertility, regardless of their HIV status.</p>

<h4><b>Planning to get pregnant</b></h4>
<p>If you are pregnant, or planning to become pregnant, it's very important to find out how you can reduce the risk of passing HIV on to your baby and to ensure you have a healthy pregnancy.</p> <p>It’s a good idea to start discussing your options with your doctor or other members of your healthcare team as soon as you start thinking about having a baby.</p>
<p>Talking to other women living with HIV who have been through the same experience can help you to make informed decisions about pregnancy, birth and looking after your baby’s health, such as having strategies in place for adhering to your treatment and for not breastfeeding.</p>
<p>You can prepare for pregnancy by making sure your viral load is low, that you and your partner are in good general health and neither of you has any <b>opportunistic infections or sexually transmitted infections (STIs)</b>.</p>
<p>If you or your partner also have <b>hepatitis C</b>, talk to your healthcare team if you are thinking about becoming pregnant.</p>
<p>You must not become pregnant while you are <b>taking ribavirin</b>, nor for six months after finishing it, nor while your partner is taking ribavirin and for six months after he has finished it.</p>
<p> It is a good idea to use at least two forms of contraception during this period.</p>

<p>There are some things all women are advised to do <b>when preparing to conceive</b>.</p>
<p> These include <b>taking folic acid (a vitamin needed to make new cells in the body)</b>.</p>

<p>If you have HIV but your partner is <b>HIV negative</b>, you can become pregnant without risking HIV transmission to him through self-insemination, sometimes referred to as <b>‘DIY’</b>.</p>
<p> This is a simple process you can do at home.</p>
<p> You will need to make sure that neither you nor your partner has a sexually transmitted infection before trying it.</p>
<p>This is best done when you are ovulating (your fertile period; see below).</p>
<p> It’s best to try the technique several times during your fertile period.</p>
<ol>
<li>Your partner will need to ejaculate into a container. The container doesn’t need to be sterile, but it should be clean and dry.</li>
<li><p>Next you’ll need a plastic syringe.</p><p> Your HIV clinic can provide them, or you can buy the kind used to give medicine to babies at a chemist.</p></li>
<li>Wait up to 30 minutes for the semen to become more liquid.</li>
<li>Draw back on the syringe once with nothing but air, then push the air out again. Now point the syringe into the liquid and slowly draw it back to suck in the semen.</li>
<li>Get into a comfortable position lying on the bed with your bottom raised on a cushion.</li>
<li><p>Either you or your partner can now slowly insert the syringe as far into the vagina as possible.</p>
<p> The area to aim for is high up in the vagina, towards the cervix.</p></li>
<li>Slowly squirt out the contents of the syringe. Gently remove the syringe.</li>
<li><p>Try to remain lying down for the next 30 minutes while the sperm makes its way through the cervix.</p>
<p> Some semen may leak out but this is normal, and doesn’t mean it won’t have worked.</li>
</ol>
<p>The healthcare team at your clinic will be able to provide <b>syringes and other equipment</b>, and information on how to calculate and recognise when you are ovulating.</p>

<h4><b>For an HIV-positive man and an HIV-negative woman</b></h4>
	<p>Where you and your partner can’t meet all the conditions that make having unprotected sex a safe option, a technique called <b>sperm washing</b> is the safest way for an HIV-positive man to biologically father a child with his HIV-negative partner.</p>
<p>Sperm washing is used to separate the seminal fluid, which contains HIV, from the sperm, which do not contain HIV. Once the sperm sample has been ‘washed’, it can be used in a range of fertility treatments.</p>
<p> The simplest of these is called <b>intra-uterine insemination (IUI)</b>.</p>
<p> The washed sperm is placed into your uterus (womb) around the time you are ovulating.</p>
<br>
<p>If you note down the dates of the beginning of each period, you will find out how long your menstrual cycle is.</p> <p>The average length is 28 days, but many women have a cycle that is shorter or longer.</p>
<p><b>To get a rough idea of your fertile time:</b></p>
<ol>
<li>Work out the date you are expecting your next period to begin.</li>
<li>Count back 16 days before this date.</li>
<li><p>Your fertile time begins around now and lasts five or six days.</p>
<p> For example, if you expect your period to begin on May 26th, your fertile time should begin around May 10th.</p></li>
</ol>
