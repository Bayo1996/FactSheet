    <div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-6">
        <p>With the right treatment and care, you can expect to live just as long as someone who doesn’t have HIV.</p>
        <p>
        There’s a lot you can do to take care of yourself and feel fitter, healthier and happier.</p>
        <p>If you have any questions, talk to your healthcare professional about nutrition, exercise, mental health or any of the other issues covered here.</p>
        <h4><b>Taking HIV treatment</b></h4>
        <p>Current treatment for HIV is not a cure for the virus, but it can keep HIV under control and this keeps your immune system strong.</p>
        <p>In the past, older HIV drugs had serious side-effects, but treatment with modern HIV drugs is much better.</p>
        <p> If a side-effect doesn’t go away and is affecting your quality of life, you should be able to change to a different drug .</p>
        <p> Once you start HIV treatment , taking it every day is important to keep yourself well. Talk to your healthcare professional if you are having any problems taking treatment.</p>

        <h4 style="color: black">Overall approach</h4>
        <p>Your immune system can be strengthened by medical treatment, food, rest and exercise.</p>
        <p>  You can cope much better if you are happy and feel productive.</p>
        <p> Emotional support and a positive attitude will help you to avoid depression.</p>
        <p> A lot can also be done to avoid the devastating effects that illness and death have on families and children.</p>

        <p>At the moment families and sometimes just individuals, cope with HIV and AIDS without much community support.</p>
        <p> In most cases, very few people know that someone is HIV positive and when they become ill, their families and children bear the burden alone.</p>
        <p> Children and partners also have to deal with the grief of watching a loved one suffer and die.</p>
        <p> Research has found that most families who lost someone, spent about one year nursing the person once they became seriously ill.</p>

         <p><b style="text-underline-position:">Counselling without treatment and nutrition will not keep someone alive.</b>
         <p> Clinic treatment without home-based care will not provide for people once they are bed-ridden.</b></p>
         <p>
        There are many examples of well-integrated projects from all over the world:</p>

        <p><b>In Sao Paolo in Brazil,Catholic nuns</b> started Project Hope to provide support and care for families affected by AIDS.</p>
        <p> They have more than 100 volunteers who each give a few hours of their time per week.</p><p> The volunteers each visit a few families where parents are ill. They provide basic care, counselling and help care for children.</p>
        <p> The project also looks after children once their parents have died.</p>
       <p> In many parts of Africa, health services work closely with community and church volunteers to care for people who are ill - especially in rural areas that are far from other services.</p>
       <p><b> Chirumhanza (Zimbabwe), Kitui (Kenya) and Kikovo (Uganda)</b> are good examples of places where health services extend the care and support they can give  by using home-based care.</p>
        <p>In South Africa there are also many projects that do very good work. Most of them work with a local hospital or clinic.</p>
        <p> Affected families are offered support and trained volunteers visit them at home. When people need medicines, grants and other support, the volunteers help them to get access to those things.</p>
        <p> The Tateni Home Care Services in Mamelodi and the Hospice project in Port Shepstone are two of the oldest home-care projects.</p>
        <p>In Thailand, the Sanpatong Family Care Project does home-based care and helps to set up support groups for people living with HIV and AIDS and their families.</p>
