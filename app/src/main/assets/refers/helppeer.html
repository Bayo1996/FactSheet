  <h4><b>Pressures</b></h4>
   <p>Transition into college and becoming a teenager/youth can be very challenging for children. Some changes include added pressures from friends and peers.</p> 
   <P>Pressures are a normal part of life and young people need guidance from their lectures, parents and other adults so that they are able to handle these pressures in a positive way.</P>
   <p>Some of these pressures may be drugs, truancy, sex, shop-lifting, bullying, cheating, and any other action that a child may not want to do.</p>

   <h4><b>What you can do?</b></h4>
   <p>Make students aware of some of the pressures they may encounter</p>
   <p>Demonstrate the difference between positive and negative peer pressure</p>
   <p>Provide suggestions and strategies to help children deal with peer pressure</p>
