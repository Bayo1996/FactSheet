<h3><b>FAMILY PLANNING AND CONTRACEPTIVES</b></h3>
<p>Basically there are 2 types of family planning/contraceptives;</p>
a) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hormonal methods;<br>
b) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are methods containing synthetic hormones (oestrogen and progestin or a combination of both)<br>
<img src ="file:///android_asset/refer/images/pi.png" style ="width:100%">
<br>
• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They mainly work by preventing ovulation and may cause hormonal side effects i.e. changes in monthly bleeding, weight or mood changes , nausea, headaches, dizziness, breast tenderness<br> 
• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Examples; emergency pills, everyday pills, injections and implants.<br>
c)  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Non-hormonal methods<br>
•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do not contain hormones<br>
•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Work by preventing fertilization<br>
•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Examples; condoms and IUCDS<br>
<h4><b>SOME OF THE FAMILY PLANNING/CONTRACEPTIVES METHOD AND HOW THEY WORK.</b></h4>
<img src ="file:///android_asset/refer/images/t.jpg" style ="width:100%">
<br><p><b>I.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; COPPER IUCDs ( coil) </b></p>
It’s made of plastic with copper wire, and strings at the bottom.
It is inserted in a woman’s uterus by a health provider
It can protect a woman for up to 12 years but can be removed at any time if she wants to get pregnant
Insertion takes a few minutes, no operation or anesthetic required
A woman may feel some discomfort or cramps during insertion, or a few days after insertion 
Its 99.4% effective<br>
<b>Advantages;</b>
<li>Very cost effective- only 400-800KES for up to 12 years</li>
 <li>Very private- no one can tell a woman is using a contraceptive</li>
<li>No hormonal side effects</li>
<li>Very convenient- no daily action, or regular visits to the clinic</li>
<li>No delay in getting pregnant</li>
<li>Can be used by breastfeeding mothers and can be inserted immediately after birth</li>
<li>Effectiveness does not depend on users obedience</li>
<b>Disadvantages</b><br>
<li>Does not protect from STIs including HIV/AIDs</li>
<li>Must be inserted and removed by a trained heath provider</li>
<li>It is possible for the IUCD to come out especially if a woman does not have children or her uterus is small. A woman should check her pad during monthly bleeding, especially in the few months after insertion</li>
<li>Not good for some women i.e. women with ovarian cancer<br>
<b>IUCDS DO NOT;</b>
<li>Increase the risk of contracting STIs or HIV/AIDs</li>
<li>Move from the uterus to other parts of the body</li>
<li>Enter the baby’s body if a woman gets pregnant with the IUCD in place</li>
<li>Cause ectopic pregnancy</li>
<li>Prevent a woman from doing heavy work</li>
<li>Harm a man during sex, unless it is not well inserted or strings are not cut short enough.</li>

<p><b>II.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CONDOMS</b></p>
<p>Male condom also known as “rubbers,” are worn over the penis to catch the sperm so they can’t enter the uterus and fallopian tubes.</p>  
<p>Most male condoms are made out of latex, a thin but strong rubber material. 
Condoms can also be made out of polyurethane. </p>
<img src="file:///android_asset/refer/images/cdss.jpg" style="width: 100%" alt=""/><br>
<p><b>Correct Use:</b> A condom is rolled onto the erect penis, leaving space at the tip for semen by squeezing the air out of the space. The male then withdraws the penis after intercourse, while it is still erect, holding the condom on the base of the penis, so it won’t slip off and spill sperm into the vagina. 
Condoms can only be used once and should then be thrown away. </p>

<h6><b>Effectiveness of male condom: </b></h6>
<p>If used consistently and correctly, male condoms are a very effective method of contraception.  
About two percent of partners who use condoms perfectly will get pregnant in the first year.   Under typical use (when they might be used inconsistently or incorrectly), </p> 
<p><b>STI Prevention:</b> Condoms are the only form of contraception that also provides protection against STIs. Male condoms are highly effective at preventing HIV and can help reduce the risk of other STIs as well.</p> 

<p><b>Female condoms</b>, also known as “internal condoms,” are soft, loose-fitting pouches with two flexible plastic rings on each end. They are put in the vagina to collect semen and block the sperm from entering the vagina.</p>

<p><b>Correct Use:</b> The female condom is inserted into the vagina with the closed side (inner ring) closest to the cervix and the open side (outer ring) left about 1 inch outside the vagina on the outer lips. 
It can be put in many hours before intercourse, but should not be left in for more than a total of eight hours. After intercourse, the female condom should be taken out immediately by gently squeezing and twisting the outer ring to keep semen inside the pouch.  This should be done before standing up.</p>  
<p>Female condoms can only be used once and should then be thrown away.</p> 
<p><b>Effectiveness:</b> If used consistently and correctly, female condoms are an effective method of contraception. About five percent of partners who use female condoms perfectly will get pregnant in the first year.   Under typical use (when they might be used inconsistently or incorrectly), about 21 percent of partners get pregnant in the first year of use. STI Prevention: If used correctly, the female condom can provide protection against STIs. Other barrier methods include diaphragms and cervical caps though these are less popular especially with young people.</p>
<p><b>III.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IMPLANTS</b></p>
It’s a small stick size of a matchstick inserted by a health provider in a woman’s arm under the skin<br>
It can protect a woman for 3- 5 years but can be removed at any given time if she wants to get pregnant<br>
It does not continue working after being removed and it does not prevent a woman from doing heavy work.<br>
<b>Advantages</b><br> 
Effectiveness does not depend on the users obedience
<li> Privacy-not easy for others to see the implant</li>
<li>Very convenient- no daily action or regular visits to the clinic</li>
<li>No delay in getting pregnant</li>
<li>Can be used by breastfeeding mo0thers from 6 weeks after giving birth</li>
<li>Cost effective</li>
<li>Must be inserted and removed by a trained healthcare provider</li>
<li>May cause hormonal side effects</li>
<li>Not good for some women i.e. those with liver disease</li>
<p><b>IV.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; INJECTIONS</b></p>
<p>Injected by a health provider in a woman’s arm buttock or thigh every month or every 3 months</p>
<p>The woman should not delay injections by more than 2 weeks (for 3 months injection) or 1 week (for monthly injection)</p>
<img src="file:///android_asset/refer/images/injections.jpg" style="width: 100%" alt=""/>

<b>Advantages</b><br>
<li>Very private</li>
<li>Convenient- no daily action</li>
<li>Some injections can be used by breastfeeding mothers from 6 weeks after giving birth</li>
<b>Disadvantages</b><br>
<li>Do not protect against STIs and HIV/AIDs</li>
<li> Cannot be stopped until the 1 or 3 months have passed</li>
<li> Must be injected by a trained health provider</li>
<li> May cause hormonal side effects</li>
<li> May delay getting pregnant by 4 or more months compared to other methods</li>
<li> Not good for some women i.e. those with high blood pressure</li>
<li> Effectiveness highly depends on users obedience</li>
<p><b>CALENDER METHOD</b></p>
-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How to identify the start and the end of the fertile period</li>
-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before relying on this method, the woman records the number of days in each menstrual cycle for at least 6 months. The first day of the menstrual bleeding is always counted as day 1.
-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Subtract 18 from the length of the shortest cycle. This tells u the estimated 1st day of the fertile time, then subtract 11 from the length of the longest cycle. This tells u the last day of your fertile time.
-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If record cycles vary from 26-32days: 
26-18=8(start abstinence on day 8)32-11=21(have sex after day 21)
<img src ="file:///android_asset/refer/images/h.jpg" style ="width:100%">
<h5><b>WITHDRAWAL METHOD</b></h5>
<li>Man interrupts intercourse and withdraws his penis from his partners vagina before he ejaculates</li>
<li> Much less effective than other methods for adolescents</li>
<li> Difficult to practice</li>
<li> No protection against STI/HIV</li>
<p><b>Disadvantage</b></p>
<li>low effectiveness</li>
<li>Requires daily record keeping</li>
<li>Vaginal infections interfere with normal mucus</li>
<li> does not prevent STI long period of training and counselling is needed before use of method</li>
<li> Both partners must be willing to co-operate</li>
<li> Too long abstinence -10-15 days of every cycle</li>
<li> Frustration due to long abstinence </li>
<p><b>Advantage</b></p>
<li>No physical side effects</li>
<li>Free</li>
<li> Promotes involvement of male partner</li>
<li> Increase knowledge of reproductive system</li>
<li> Can be used either to achieve or to avoid pregnancy </li>
<li> Encourages couple communication and co-operation</li>
<h3>EMERGENCIY CONTRACEPTIVE</h3>
<h3>DEF:</h3> 
<p>
-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Contraceptive methods used to prevent pregnancy after unprotected sex. Sometimes it is called post-coital method or “morning after”</p>
<p>
-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ECP can be used within 120 hrs. of sexual intercourse but the sooner the treatment, the more effective.</p>
<p>
-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ideally antiemetic’s should be offered with EC to reduce the chances of vomiting.</p>
<p><b>How EC works</b></p>

 Inhibition of transportation of the egg/sperm
 Prevention of ovulation<br>
