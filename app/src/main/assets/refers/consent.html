<h5><b>WHAT’S CONSENT?</b></h5>
<p><b>Sexual consent</b> is an agreement to participate in a sexual activity.</p>
<p> Before being sexual with someone, you need to know if they want to be sexual with you too.</p>
<p> It’s also important to be honest with your partner about what you want and don’t want.</p>
<p>Consenting and asking for consent are all about setting your personal boundaries and respecting those of your partner — and checking in if things aren’t clear.</p>
<p> Both people must agree to sex — every single time — for it to be consensual.</p>

<p>Without consent, sexual activity (including oral sex, genital touching, and vaginal or anal penetration) is sexual assault or rape.</p>
<p>Here are the basics of consent. <b>Consent is:</b>
	<ul>
 <li>	Freely given. Consenting is a choice you make without pressure, manipulation, or under the influence of drugs or alcohol.</li>
<li><b>Reversible.</b> Anyone can change their mind about what they feel like doing, anytime. Even if you’ve done it before, and even if you’re both naked in bed.</li>
<li><b>	Informed.</b> You can only consent to something if you have the full story. For example, if someone says they’ll use a condom and then they don’t, there isn’t full consent.</li>
<li><b>	Enthusiastic.</b> When it comes to sex, you should only do stuff you WANT to do, not things that you feel you’re expected to do.</li>
<li><b>Specific.</b> Saying yes to one thing (like going to the bedroom to make out) doesn’t mean you’ve said yes to others (like having sex).</li>
</ul>

<p>You get the final say over what happens with your body. It doesn’t matter if you’ve hooked up before or even if you said yes earlier and then changed your mind.</p>
<p> You’re allowed to say “stop” at any time, and your partner needs to respect that.</p>

<p><b>Consent</b> is never implied by things like your past behavior, what you wear, or where you go.</p>
<p> Sexual consent is always clearly communicated — there should be no question or mystery.</p>
<p> Silence is not consent. And it’s not just important the first time you’re with someone.</p>
<p> Couples who’ve had sex before or even ones who’ve been together for a long time also need to consent before sex — every time.</p>

<p>There are laws about who can consent and who can’t.</p>
<p> People who are drunk, high, or passed out can’t consent to sex.</p>
<p> There are also laws to protect minors (people under the age of 18) from being pressured into sex with someone much older than them.</p>
<p>The age of sexual consent is how old a person needs to be in order to be considered legally capable of consenting to sex.</p>
<p> Adults who have sex with someone younger than the age of consent face jail time and being registered as a sex offender.</p>
<p> The age of consent varies in different parts and in different countries. There may also be other laws that define the age of sexual consent by state.</p>
