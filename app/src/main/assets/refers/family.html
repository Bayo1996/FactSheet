<li><b>What is family planning?</b>
<p>This is basically planning your family. In other words having a child when you want it, and a family size that you want.</p>
<p>Having a child need not be an accident, it should be a decision.</p></li>
<li><b>What family planning methods are available?</b>
<p>There are natural methods and contraceptive methods.</p> 
<p>Healthcare workers advocate for contraceptive use because over several years they have proved to be more reliable.</p> <p>The natural methods are prone to human error and can result in unplanned pregnancy.</p> 
<p><b>Contraceptives</b> include
<ol> <li> IUCDs</li><li>  Implants </li> <li> Injectable</li> <li>Oral pills</li>
</ol></p>
 <p>Natural methods include: <b>Safe days, withdrawal</b></p>


<p><b>NOTE :</b>
<ol> 
<li>Family planning does not protect against HIV and STIs.</li> 
<li>If you develop complications with one method you should try another methods. Do not write them off. Unwanted pregnancy can change your life for the worse.</li>
</ol></p> 
</li>

<br><br><li><b>Why should I or my girlfriend take up a family planning method?</b>
<p>Unplanned or unwanted pregnancies can seriously hinder personal growth, result in medical complication, and cause family and relationship conflict.</p> 
<p>Sex is meant to be enjoyed. Family planning allows individuals to be free of the stress of the possibility of an unplanned/unwanted pregnancy.</p>
<p>While adolescents are usually sexually mature, they are often not emotionally, psychologically and economically ready to be parents/couples. </p>
<p><b>Adolescent girls</b> are prone to having premature babies, malnourished babies, the immaturity of the pelvis system can lead to birth complications including fistula to the girl and birth asphyxia in the child.</p>
<p><b>A girls</b> education and job prospects can be stalled due to an unplanned pregnancy.</p>
<p><b>A boys</b> future too can be affected including stopping schooling, unplanned and unwanted marriage, disfranchisation from premature economic responsibilities among others.</p> 
</li></ol>
<h5><b>WHAT DO I NEED TO KNOW ABOUT FAMILY PLANNING?</b></h5>
<p>If you have vaginal sex and you don’t want to get pregnant, use family planning. Family planning can have other benefits, too (like helping with PMS and acne).</p>

<ul><b>Should I get on family planning?</b>

<li>You can get pregnant anytime you have penis-in-vagina (AKA vaginal) sex, including the very first time you have sex. So if you have vaginal sex — or think you might sometime soon — and you don’t want to get pregnant, use family planning method.</li>

<li>There are lots of different kinds of family planning. Some work better than others. But using any type of family planning is better than using nothing at all. People who have vaginal sex without family planning have an 85% chance of getting pregnant within a year</li>
<li><p>Preventing pregnancy isn’t the only reason people use family planning — it can have lots of other benefits, too.</p>

<p> Some kinds of hormonal birth control (like the pill, patch, implant, and the hormonal IUD) can do things like ease cramps and PMS, and make your periods lighter.</p>
<p> The pill, patch, and ring can also help with acne and make your periods more regular.</p><p> Almost everybody uses family planning at some point.</p></li>

<li>Bottom line: if there’s a chance you’ll be doing any sexy stuff that can lead to pregnancy, family planning is your friend. You can ask your doctor about getting on family planning, whatever your reason.</li>
</ul>


<p><b>How do I get Family planning?</b></p>
<p>You can get some types of family planning, like condoms, at chemist or convenience hospitals/shops.</p>
<p> Anybody can buy condoms, and you don’t need to show your ID.</p>
<p> Sometimes you can get free condoms from community clinics, your school nurse.</p> <p>Condoms help protect you from STDs, too! So it’s good to use condoms even if you’re on another method of birth control.</p>
<p>You need to see a doctor or nurse to know which contraceptives are available in your country.</p>
<p> These are  <a href='https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/iud' target='_blank'>IUD</a>, <a href='https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/birth-control-implant-implanon' target='_blank'>implant</a>, <a href='https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/birth-control-shot' target='_blank'>shot</a>, <a href='https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/birth-control-pill' target='_blank'>pill</a>, <a href='https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/birth-control-patch' target='_blank'>patch</a>, or <a href='https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/birth-control-vaginal-ring-nuvaring' target='_blank'>ring</a>.</p>
<p> These are often available in most health facilities including comprehensive care clinics (Check directory)</p>
<p><b>What do I need before the doctors do before giving me the contraceptive?</b></p>
<p> 
Usually you don’t need a full examination to get family planning.</p>
<p> But what happens at your appointment depends on your personal health, the doctor’s policies, and the kind of family planning you want.</p>
<p> Here’s some stuff you can expect:
	<ul>
<li>Your nurse or doctor will talk with you about your medical history (ask you questions about your health in the past) and check your blood pressure. Sometimes they do a <a href='https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/health-and-wellness/well-woman-visit/what-pelvic-exam' target='_blank'>pelvic exam</a>, but they usually don’t need to.</li>
<li>The nurse or doctor may ask about your sex life: whether you’ve ever had sex, what kinds of sex, how many people you’ve had sex with, if you’ve used birth control before, etc. It’s super important to be honest so they can give you the best possible care. Doctors aren’t there to judge and they’ve heard it all before — they just want to help you stay healthy.</li>
<li>You can also ask any questions you have about family planning. You might want to talk with your doctor about the IUD or implant — these types of birth control are the easiest to use and work the best.</li>
<li>If you get the IUD or implant, your doctor will give it to you in the health center. If you choose the pill, patch , you’ll probably get a prescription. You can use the prescription to pick up your birth control at a drugstore or pharmacy. Some doctors might even have pills or patches in the health center to give to you at your appointment.</li>
</ul></p>

<p><b>Can the doctor tell your parents/ partner that I am on a family planning method?</b></p> 
<ul><li>Not in many countries. This is often a confidential matter and the doctor will only do this if you request them to.</li>
<li>However, in some countries/hospitals the policies might be different. Ask your doctor about this during your visit</li> 
<li>Either way, talking to your parents and your partner about birth control can be really helpful.</li> 
</ul>

<p><b>What if I mess up or don’t use family planning?</b>
	<ul>
<li>If you make a mistake or have sex without using family planning/ contraceptives at all, don’t freak out — you still have a few days to try to prevent pregnancy by using <b>emergency contraceptives.</b></li>
<li><b>EMERGENCY CONTRACEPTION</b> is a kind of birth control that can help prevent pregnancy up to 5 days after unprotected sex. Emergency contraception means taking a “morning-after pill” or getting a copper IUD.</li>
<li>You can get some kinds of morning-after pills at the drugstore or at your local clinic without a prescription. But it’s important to take it as soon as possible after unprotected sex, or it won’t work as well.</li> 
<li>Getting a copper IUD within 5 days after unprotected sex is the most effective kind of emergency contraception. But a doctor needs to put the IUD in, and sometimes it can be hard to get an appointment on short notice.</li>
