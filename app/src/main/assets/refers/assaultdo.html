<p><b>How can I help a friend who was sexually assaulted?</b></p>
<p> One of the biggest things you can do is to just be there. Here are some basic dos and don’ts for helping a friend who’s been raped, abused, or assaulted:</p>


<p><b>Do:</b><ul>
<li>Listen to their story and believe them</li>
<li>  Tell them that what happened wasn’t their fault</li>
<li>  Share resources like LACE, your nearest rape crisis service, or health facility with them</li>
<li>  Encourage them to talk with a trusted adult if they haven’t already. Offer to go with them to get help</li>
</ul></p>
<p><b>Don’t:</b><ul>
<li>  Tell them how they could’ve avoided what happened</li>
<li>  Tell anyone else what happened unless they ask you to</li>
<li>  Pressur
e them into talking with the police</li>
<li>  Threaten to hurt the person who hurt them</li>
</ul></p>

<p>Dealing with any kind of sexual violence takes time.</p>
<p> They might not even think of it as assault/abuse/rape right away. There’s no such thing as a “right way” for someone to react.</p>
<p>  
It’s also really important to take care of yourself when you’re trying to be there for a friend who’s been hurt. Hearing about the sexual violence of someone you love, even when you’re not the one it happened to, can be really upsetting.</p>
<p><b> LACE</b>  has really great information on how hearing about this stuff might make you feel and how you can take care of yourself.</p>
