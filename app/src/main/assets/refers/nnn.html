<h4><b>Disclosure in the Workplace</b></h4> 
<h4><b>Co-Workers</b></h4>
<p><p>
  Sometimes strong friendships develop with co-workers. In such situations, it's natural to want to tell a co-worker friend with whom you feel particularly close about your HIV status.<p>
  <p> There may also be times when you're feeling particularly upset or stressed about something related to your status and have the impulse to disclose what's on your mind.</p>
  <P>Even with a co-worker who's a good friend, give careful consideration to disclosing your positive status.</P>
  <p> There's a balance to be maintained between the natural exchanges which occur in a friendship and protecting your need for privacy.</p>
  <p> Be aware that even what you've said in confidence may still end up becoming the subject of gossip in the workplace.</p>
  <p> When that happens, gossip can move up and down in the chain of command in the workplace, with unforeseen results that may have serious consequences.</p>
  <p> Once you have disclosed your status, it's very hard—if not impossible—to take the information back.</p> <p>Your co-worker friend may very well live up to your best expectations. But you have to be prepared to deal with potential disappointments as well.</P></p>
<h6><b>General tips to consider with regard to the workplace:</b></h6>
<ol>
  <li>Tell the person you have something important to tell them.</li>
  <li>Stress that what you're going to discuss be kept in the strictest confidence.</li>
  <li>Keep what you say as simple and as direct as possible.</li>
  <li>Tell them why you want them to know.</li>
  <li>Let them know you are sorting out issues related to your HIV status and their support is important to you.</li>
  </ol>
 <h4><b>Employers</b></h4>  
<p>
  <p>If you're applying for a job, prospective employers do not have the right to make inquiries about your health or the existence of a disability prior to a conditional job offer.</p>
  <p> However, they may legally inquire if you are aware of any physical limitation that would interfere with your ability to perform the essential functions of the job.</p>
   <p>In a situation where an HIV-related illness is interfering with your work to the extent that it might place your employment in jeopardy, arranging to sit down privately with your boss and revealing your situation may be the way to go.</p>
   <p> You might even consider bringing a letter from your doctor explaining the current state of your condition, and how it might affect your ability to perform your job.</p>
   </p>
<h6><b>General tips to consider with regard to employers:</b></h6>
<ol>
  <li>Unless your HIV status affects your current ability to perform your job, you are under no legal obligation to disclose your status to your employer.</li>
  <li>Consider very carefully what your purpose is for disclosing your status to your employer.</li>
  <li>If you do disclose, tell the person you want to speak with that you have something important to discuss with them.</li>
  <li>Stress that you're requesting that what you're going to discuss be kept in strict confidence.</li>
  <li>Be mindful that a request for confidentially is not an absolute guarantee that it will be respected.</li>
   <li>Some employers will rise to the occasion and be supportive. Others may be disappointing in their responses, and you will understandably feel hurt and angry.</li>
   <li>Keep what you say as simple and as direct as possible.</li>
   <li>Tell them you are receiving appropriate health care.</li>
    <li>Mention if you may need a particular accommodation, such as occasional time off for a medical appointment.</li>
    <li>Tell your boss that you will make every effort to insure that your work is properly covered and that you're committed to doing your job reliably and well.</li>
   <li>Medical-related employer decisions about HIV (or any other disability) must be based on facts about you, not simply an employer's opinions about HIV.</li>
</ol>
