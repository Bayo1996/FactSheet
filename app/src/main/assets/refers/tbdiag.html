 <p>Many countries still rely on a long-used method called <b>sputum smear microscopy</b> to diagnose TB.</p>
 <p> Trained laboratory technicians look at sputum samples under a microscope to see if TB bacteria are present.</p>
 <p> Microscopy detects only half the number of TB cases and cannot detect drug-resistance.</p>
<p>The use of the <b>rapid test Xpert MTB/RIF®</b> has expanded substantially since 2010, when WHO first recommended its use.</p>
<p> The test simultaneously detects TB and resistance to <b>rifampicin, the most important TB medicine</b>.</p>
<p> Diagnosis can be made within 2 hours and the test is now recommended by WHO as the initial diagnostic test in all persons with signs and symptoms of TB.</p>
<p>Diagnosing multi-drug resistant and extensively drug-resistant TB as well as HIV-associated TB can be complex and expensive.</p>
<p> In 2016, 4 new diagnostic tests were recommended by WHO :–</p>
<p> a rapid molecular test to detect TB at peripheral health centres where Xpert MTB/RIF cannot be used, and <b>3 tests</b> to detect resistance to first- and second-line TB medicines.</p>
<p>Tuberculosis is particularly difficult to diagnose in children and as yet only the <b>Xpert MTB/RIF assay</b> is generally available to assist with the diagnosis of paediatric TB.</p>
