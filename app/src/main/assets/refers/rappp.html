<h4><b>Can boys/Men be raped?</b></h4> 
<ul>
 <li><b>Sexual violence</b> is a serious health and human rights problem in Kenya. Sexual violence  affects men  and  women,  boys  and  girls and  has  adverse  physical  and psycho-social consequences on the survivor.</li> 
<li>The National guidelines on management of sexual violence in Kenya outlines the standard operating procedures for various actors who get into contact with the survivors; both Male and female. <b>Therefore boys/men also suffer sexual related violence in all its forms.</b></li>
</ul>
<p>Itâ€™s wise to be aware that living in a society where violence is accepted makes people feel as if they can get what they want by using violence (rape). Other societal forces that make rape more likely to occur are the unfair and unequal treatment of women, the representation of women in the media and in pornographic materials as nothing more than sexual objects, and a widespread acceptance of rape. </p> 
<p>Many people believe that rape occurs because of <b>strong sexual urges that men cannot control. But we know that men can control sexual urges and delay sexual gratification.</b></p> 
<p>Research has shown that rape is more associated with power than with sexual gratification. Most rapists commit their crimes so that they can feel powerful and in control. In fact, many rapists fail to get an erection or ejaculate. Combine this with the fact that most women who are raped show absolutely no sign of sexual response and a person can understand that rape would not be a very sexually gratifying act. Instead it is an act of violence.</p>
