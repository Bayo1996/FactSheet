       <h4><b>What is a Parent/Child Relationship?</b></h4>
       <p>The Parent/Child Relations is a special type of a bond that arises between a caregiver and a child. It consists of a combination of behaviors, feelings, and expectations that are unique to a particular parent and a particular child. Of the many different relationships people form over the course of the life span, the relationship between parent and child is among the most important. The quality of the parent-child relationship can be affected by the parent's age, experience, or self-confidence; the stability of the parents' marriage; and the unique characteristics of the child compared with those of the parent. </p>
        <h4><b>FACTORS THAT CAN INFLUENCE THE PARENT/CHILD RELATIONSHIP</b></h4>
        <p>At times the parent/child relationship can face many challenges:
        <ul><li>Death of a parent</li>
        <li>Illness of the parent or the child</li>
        <li> Divorce and re-marriage Financial problems Misunderstanding due to age/generation differences. For example, differences in lifestyle, dressing, behavior, or some cultural practices</li>
        <li> Transition from childhood to adulthood</li></p>
      </ul>
       <h4><b>How can I help my child to improve adherence to their medication?</b></h4>
       <p>For any person, taking medication is not always easy.  At times, we can forget or have issues come up that make us not take medication. It’s good to have a strategy of making it more friendly, like taking the medicines together. You can be your child’s medicine buddy. A medicine buddy can remind someone to take medicines and reward the person if medicines are taken daily!</p>
      <h4><b>How can I have a good relationship with my child?</b></h4>
      <p>Most relationships thrive when there is room for growth. Below are important considerations for parents to enhance a good relationship: 
      <ul>
      <li><b>Interact with your child.</b></li><p>
       Parents are often strict or too busy to interact with their children. Encourage your children to talk to you. When you open up to your children and are willing to talk with them, particularly adolescents, it helps them grow and helps your relationship grow.</p> 
      <li><b>Read nonverbal communication.</b></li><p>
       Children do not always talk about the things that they are going through. As a parent, you can see their mood in other ways. Is your child happy, sad, energized or dull? Paying attention to your child’s non-verbal cues will give you an opportunity to reach out to them.</p>
       <li><b> Follow your child’s interests.</b></li><p> Our children may have hobbies or interests that we, as parents, may not like. Try to accommodate their interests and let them grow into their personalities.</p>
       </ul>
       </p>
       <h4><b>How can I continue having a good relationship with my child as she/he enters adolescence?</b></h4>
       <p>As a child transitions to adulthood, this stage is called adolescence. In adolescence, so many things happen that can affect your relationship. There are physical, emotional, social, and mental changes that take place during this stage, including the desire for more independence. Many parents find early adolescence a difficult period. Adolescents fare best and their parents are happiest when parents can be both encouraging and accepting of the child's needs for more psychological independence.</p>
       <h4><b>Communicate with kindness and respect</b></h4>
       <p>Young teens can say or do things that are outrageous, mean-spirited, or both. However hard your child pushes your buttons, it's best to respond calmly. The respect and self-control that you display in talks with your child may some day be reflected in her conversations with others. The key is being understanding as well as balancing the need for independence and good guidance.</p>
       <h4><b>How can I start disclosing about HIV to my child?</b></h4>
       <p>Establishing a good relationship with your child from an early age will give you a strong ground to be open about issues that will affect their lives. Ideally, a parent could be open in this relationship, even if they are not giving the child all of the information yet. Disclosure is a process and one needs to be physically and emotionally strong for the process. The first step is being open and honest.</p>
       <h4><b>When will my child be ready for disclosure?</b></h4>
       <p>When children get to the adolescent stage, they are more aware of their environment, their bodies, and their lives. Therefore, it’s important to start this process when they first become more aware about themselves.  You can tell this stage is starting when the child begins asking many questions</p>
       <h4><b>My child asks so many questions, how do I answer them? </b></h4>
       <p>Listen to the questions your child is asking and always have something positive to say. Most children will ask, “Why am I taking medicines when am not sick? Why don't other children take medicines daily and yet I do?” Often as a parent you will have an inclination to lie so they stop asking many questions, but that may lead to distrust when they know the truth. We encourage you to be honest and to be positive. </p>
       <h4><b>What if my child blames me for giving him/her HIV?</b></h4>
       <p>Remember that you are not a bad parent. You have made a positive decision to take care of your health and your child’s health. Although sometimes HIV can be acquired as a consequence of a bad decision made by yourself or by your partner, like your child, you didn’t choose to have HIV! When you feel overcome with shame and guilt, it may lead to stress, and you may not be able to help your child during disclosure.  One strategy for addressing your child’s blame is to remind the child how much you love them, and that is why you are disclosing to them now.  It is important for your child to understand their HIV status so they can live positively and grow up healthy.  The fact that you are telling your child they are HIV positive means that you love them.</p>
