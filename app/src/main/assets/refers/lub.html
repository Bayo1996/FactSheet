<h4><b>Lubricants for Latex Condoms</b></h4>
<p>Lubrication helps avoid condom breakage.</p>
<p> There are 3 ways to provide lubricationâ€”<b>natural vaginal secretions, adding a lubricant, or using condoms packaged with lubricant on them</b>.</p>

<p>Sometimes lubricants made of glycerine or silicone, which are safe to use with latex condoms, are available.</p>
<p> Clean water and saliva also can be used for lubrication.</p>
<p> Lubricants should be applied on the outside of the condom, in the vagina, or in the anus.</p> 
<p>Lubricants should not be put on the penis, as this can make the condom slip off.</p>
<p> A drop or two of lubricant on the inside of the condom before it is unrolled can help increase the sensation of sex for some men.</p>
<p> Too much lubricant inside, however, can make the condom slip off.</p>
<p>
Do not use products made with oil as lubricants for latex condoms.</p>
<p> They can damage latex. Materials that should not be used include:</p>
<ul>
<li> any oils (cooking, baby, coconut, mineral)</li>
<li> petroleum jelly</li>
<li> lotions</li>
<li> cold creams butter</li>
<li> cocoa butter</li>
<li>margarine</li>
</ul>
<h4><b>What Condom Users Should Not Do</b></h4>
<p>Some practices can increase the risk that the condom will break and should be avoided.</p>
<ul>
<li>Do not unroll the condom first and then try to put it on the penis</li>
<li>Do not use lubricants with an oil base because they damage latex</li>
<li>	Do not use a condom if the color is uneven or changed</li>
<li>	Do not use a condom that feels brittle, dried out, or very sticky</li>
<li>	Do not reuse condoms</li>
<li>	Do not have dry sex</li>
</ul>

<p>Also, do not use the same condom when switching between different penetrative sex acts, such as from anal to vaginal sex.</p>
<p> This can transfer bacteria that can cause infection.</p>

<h4><b>New Problems That May Require Switching Methods</b></h4>

<p>May or may not be due to method.</p>

<p>Female partner is using miconazole or econazole (for treatment of vaginal infections)</p>
<ul>
<li>A woman should not rely on latex condoms during vaginal use of miconazole or econazole. They can damage latex. (Oral treatment will not harm condoms.)</li>
<li>She should use female condoms or plastic male condoms, another contraceptive method, or abstain from sex until treatment is completed.</li>
<p>
Severe allergic reaction to condom (hives or rash over much of body, dizziness, difficulty breathing, or loss of consciousness during or after condom use).</p>
<p>See <a href="https://www.fphandbook.org/book/fph_appendix_b/index.shtml" target="_blank">Signs and Symptoms of Serious Health Conditions</a>.</p>
<li>	 Stop using latex condoms.</li>
<li>	Refer for care, if necessary. Severe allergic reaction to latex could lead to life-threatening anaphylactic shock. Choose another method.</li>
<li>	If the client or partner cannot avoid risk of STIs, suggest they use female condoms or plastic male condoms, if available. If neither partner has an infection, a mutually faithful sexual relationship provides STI protection without requiring condom use but does not protect against pregnancy.</li>
</ul>
