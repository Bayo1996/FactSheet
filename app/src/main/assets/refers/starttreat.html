<p>It’s better to start HIV treatment <b>sooner</b>, rather than later.</p>
<p>Treatment will reduce the <b>risk of HIV transmission, prevent illnesses and extend your life</b>.</p>

<p>A range of different antiretroviral drugs are available.</p>
<p>Anti-HIV drugs work by lowering the amount of HIV in the blood (viral load). The aim of HIV treatment is an undetectable viral load.</p>
<p> This means that the amount of HIV in a blood sample is so low that it cannot be detected using a standard test.</p>
<p> Reducing the amount of HIV in your blood allows your immune system (measured by your CD4 cell count ) to strengthen.</p>
<p> The higher your CD4 cell count, the lower your risk of becoming ill because of HIV (and possibly some other serious illnesses as well).</p>
<p>You should discuss with your doctor the <b>best time</b> for you to start HIV treatment.</p> 
<p><b>There are a number of factors you might want to consider, including:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The benefits of starting treatment now.</li>
<li>The potential risks if you delay starting treatment.</li>
<li>Are you ready to start treatment now?</li>
<li>Are there other factors in your life that affect your ability to start taking HIV treatment?</li>
</ul>
<h4><b>When to start treatment</b></h4>
<p>Until recently, doctors weren’t sure of the best time to start HIV treatment.</p>
<p> However in 2015 a large, well-conducted study demonstrated that there are advantages to starting treatment as soon as possible, with high CD4 cell counts.</p>
<p> The study clearly demonstrated that starting HIV treatment earlier reduces the risk of serious illnesses, AIDS and death.</p>
<p> While people sometimes worry about the side-effects of anti-HIV drugs, the study also showed that people who began HIV treatment earlier had a better quality of life than people who waited.</p>
<p>Because of this, HIV treatment guidelines, both in the UK and elsewhere in the world, now recommend that all people with HIV should take HIV treatment, regardless of their CD4 count.</p>

<p>If your CD4 cell count is below 200, it is especially important that you begin HIV treatment as soon as possible.</p>
