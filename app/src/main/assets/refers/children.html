<h4><b>Living with HIV</b></h4>
<p>With careful management of their health, children with HIV can have a happy, normal and – thanks to HIV treatment – long life.</p>
<p>However, your child will grow up with different experiences to other children, and this could affect how they feel about themselves, as well as leading to a feeling of being different or alone.</p>
<p><b> Stigma and discrimination</b> may be experienced, as might sadness, illness, or the separation from or death of loved ones.</p>
<p><b>Loving and supporting</b> your child will provide the foundation for living through these issues.</p>
<p> Helping them recognise that planning their days, developing a routine around their medication and talking to someone they can trust, will help them to adjust to the diagnosis and management of HIV.</p>
<h4><b>Day-to-day life</b></h4>
<p>Children often get cuts or grazes whilst playing.</p>
<p><b> Follow standard first aid advice:</b>
<ol>
<li>Wash the wound thoroughly under running water.</li>
<li>Pat the area dry with a clean towel.</li>
<li>Apply a sticking plaster or another form of sterile dressing.</li>
<li>Keep any eye on the wound in case an infection develops.</li>
</ol>

<p>Similarly, if somebody else comes into contact with your child’s blood, it should be washed off with soap and running water.</p>
<p>The risk of being infected with the virus through open cuts and abrasions is extremely small.</p>
<p> It’s impossible to contract HIV through intact, healthy skin.</p><p> Similarly, the risk of HIV being passed on by biting is extremely low.</p>
<p>It’s probably a good idea not to let your child share objects which may have had contact with blood, such as <b>toothbrushes</b>, although HIV transmission this way is highly unlikely.</p>
<p>HIV cannot be passed on by sharing cutlery, plates or cups, because HIV cannot be transmitted in saliva.</p>
<p> It can not be transmitted by social contact, through the air, by touching objects handled by an HIV-positive person or by sharing baths with someone who has HIV.</p>
