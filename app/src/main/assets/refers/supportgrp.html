<p style="font-size: 15px">“<b>I wanted to see other people with HIV.
<p>We gained strength just from knowing each other</b>”</p>
The stigma surrounding HIV and AIDS makes life more difficult for people living with HIV and AIDS and their families. <b>Loneliness, anxiety, stress, confusion, bitterness and depression</b> can make people more vulnerable to illness if they do not get any kind of support.
 <p>Youths living with HIV need a lot of <b>emotional, spiritual, psychological, social, physical and clinical support.</b></p>
<p>It is important for youth living with HIV to <b>come together and support one another.</p></b>
<P> People living with HIV would know better what their <b> hopes, joys, anxieties, fears and needs </b> are and they are the ones who should define how best they want to be understood and treated.</P>
<p>Some of the common needs of people living with HIV are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Health and medical supplies and skilled medical services.</li>
<li>Counselling to reduce isolation and promote acceptance.</li>
<li>Community support groups to provide a safe place where feelings and advice can be shared.</li>
<li>Spiritual support such as prayer groups and home visits by religious leaders.</li>
</ul></p>

<h4><b>Disclosure</h4></b>
<p style="font-size: 15px">This is a<b> difficult </b>area for all people living with HIV,  the leader and other support group members should be patient with one another.</p>
 <p>Disclosure is difficult for some support group members because sometimes members will not have told their <b>families, friends or partners. </b>
 <p>The individual members will want at times to <b>first </b>deal with their own<b> emotions</b> before they tell other people. This process is important and should be allowed to take its course.
</p>
<h4><b>Acceptance</b></h4>
<p style="font-size: 15px">This matter needs to be discussed with support group members.</p>
<p> <b>Members of a new group may be at different stages in terms of when they were diagnosed.</b> Those who are newly diagnosed may be in a state of <b>shock and be very anxious</b>. Those who have lived with their diagnosis for longer may have <b>accepted </b> it and learned to live with it.
Members should be <b>assessed and evaluated</b> from time to time to see where they are in terms of:
<b>
<ul>
<li> accepting their status</li>
<li> What would help them to be in control of their status</li>
<li> What kind of support do they need</li> 
<li>Who is important to give them that support?</li>
<li> What difficulties do they encounter at certain points</li>
<li> What would make them feel better?</li> 
</ul>
</b>
</p>
<p>Discussing these questions with individuals or in the group can help people to be in touch with their feelings.</p>

<h4><b>Tips for running meetings</b></h4>
<h5><b>Its very wise to develop a plan of action</b></h5></p>
<p style="font-size: 15px">Once everyone is clear on the <b>purpose of the group</b> as expressed in the vision, the members can develop <b>a plan of action. A plan of action should include specific things that the group wishes to chieve to help make the vision a reality.</b>
They could include things like <b>“ learning to stand up for our rights as patients” or “learning to eat the right things or “learning relaxation”</b>.
Discuss exactly <b>what you need to do to make the plan of action a success. Will you invite an expert to address the group? Do you need to get some materials such as tapes or CDs?</b> Make sure someone is given the job to follow-up on each issue.
A plan of action should be <b>REALISTICS.</b> The group should not try and do too much too soon.
<b>Examples of what can be done in a support group:</b>
<ol>
<li><b>Talks and presentations from experts:-</b></li>
<li><b>Social events:-</b></li>
<li><b>Group and individual counselling sessions:-</b></li><br>
</ol></p>

<h4><b>Protecting yourself against re-infection</b></h4>
<p style="font-size: 15px">The group should discuss the need to protect themselves against re-infection. </p>
<p>Some people with HIV think that they can be in no further danger if they have sex without a condom because they are already infected. This is not true! <b>HIV has many different strains, some of them very powerful.</b>
</p><p> If a person with HIV fails to protect themselves against further infection, he or she may contact a strain of HIV that is <b>more dangerous than the strain they already have.</b></p>
<h4><b>Protecting others</b></h4>
<p style="font-size: 15px"><b>A very important role</b> of the group should to be to ensure that the members learn how to not spread HIV to others.</p>
<p> In group meetings remind the members that they not only have a responsibility to look after their own health but must also protect others from contacting the virus.</p>
<p>This means that a youth with HIV must ensure that a condom is used each and every time she or he has sex.
 </p>In the group, talk about the difficulties members might have with condom use. </p>
 This may include issues such as <b>being embarrassed to buy or ask for condoms or thinking that condoms reduce sexual pleasure.</b>
  <p>Some women may be afraid to ask husbands or boyfriends to use them.<b> Ensure that the members know exactly how to use condoms properly</b>
Youths with HIV should ensure that they keep their toothbrushes and razors for their own use and should not use someone else’s toothbrush or razor. HIV can spread through fresh blood on these items.</p>
<h4><b>Correcting Misunderstandings</b></h4>
<p style="font-size: 15px">The group should also play a role in correcting some common misunderstandings on how HIV is spread.</p>
<p><b> HIV CANNOT</b> be spread through any social or affectionate touching which does not involve the exchange of bodily fluids. Kissing is a very low risk activity. Sharing the same bedding is perfectly safe. HIV-positive and negative people can share meals together with no risk whatsoever. While sharing the same kitchen utensils cannot transmit HIV, this can transmit TB and flu viruses.</p>
<h4><b>Correct condom use</b></h4>
<p style="font-size: 15px"><b>Using condoms correctly </b>will greatly reduce the risk of HIV infection.</p>
<p> While some may find the issue a little embarrassing, it is important that group members have the opportunity to discuss <b>proper condom use and ask questions.</b> The support group can help to correct any misunderstandings about condom use.</p>

<h4><b>Evaluation of the support group</b></h4>
<p>Evaluation is <b>judging the effectiveness</b> of the support group in meeting the needs of the group members. </
<p>Every so often the group should <b>re-examine its vision </b>and see to if the <b>activities and functions</b> of the group are <b>helping</b> make that vision a reality.</p>
<p>If the group is off-track with its vision or goals then the members need to discuss <b>how the group can change its focus</b> to style="max-width: 100%" align="left"> better meet the needs.</b> <b>Brainstorm</b> with the members and list all the <b>strengths and the weaknesses</b> of the group. </p>
<p>Address each weakness and discuss what the group could do to help turn them into strengths.</p>
<p>The needs of group members may change over time. When this occurs the group can <b>revisit</b> its vision and change it to suit the changing needs.</p>
