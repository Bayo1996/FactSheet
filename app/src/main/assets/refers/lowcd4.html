<p>The most important thing is to start HIV treatment, and to take it exactly the way you are advised to (this is often called <b>adherence</b> ).</p>
<p>Attend your HIV clinic for regular check-ups.</p>
<p> These monitor how your treatment is working, with regular screening for other health problems.</p>
<p> Having a good relationship with your healthcare team is important, so that you feel able to be honest about your health, lifestyle, adherence and any other issues, to help you receive the best possible care and support.</p>
<p>Register with a <b>GP (family doctor)</b> for non-HIV-related health problems.</p>
<p> GPs can give you an annual flu vaccination (recommended for people with a weakened immune system), and provide advice on lifestyle factors that help keep you well, including healthy eating , exercise and giving up smoking .</p>
<p>While your CD4 count is low (under 200), ensure your drinking water is free from infection and take extra care in preparing and storing food to avoid food poisoning.</p>
<p> Be careful to avoid infections if you are handling animals or gardening.</p>
<p> Your healthcare team can talk to you about any risks and give you advice.</p>
