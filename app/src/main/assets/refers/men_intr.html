<p>Each ovary holds <b>hundreds of thousands of pinpoint-sized eggs.</b> Girls are born with all the eggs they will ever have.</p>
<p>
 <b>After puberty,</b> one ovary releases a mature egg about once a month. <b>This is called ovulation.</b></p> 
<p><b>Before ovulation,</b> the uterus builds up a spongy, soft lining made of tissue and blood. This lining is like a nest for the egg if pregnancy happens.</p> 
<p><b>After ovulation,</b> the egg moves through one of the fallopian tubes toward the uterus. Most of the time, the egg is not fertilized, and breaks apart before it gets to the uterus. The lining of the uterus that built up is not needed and begins to flow out of the uterus, through the cervix and vagina out of the body. This is called menstruation or a <b>“period.”</b></p> 
<p>
When a man and woman have intercourse and the man ejaculates, millions of sperm are released in the vagina. The sperm swim through the vagina, to the uterus, and into the fallopian tubes. If there are sperm in the fallopian tubes when the egg is released they can join together. <b>This is called fertilization.</b> </p>
<p>There are only certain days during a month when a woman can become pregnant through vaginal intercourse. The egg lives for about a day after ovulation and sperm can live from three to six days in the fallopian tubes. Therefore, there are about seven days during each month when a woman can get pregnant. If fertilized, the egg then travels the rest of the way through the fallopian tubes and attaches to the lining of the uterus. This is called <b>implantation</b>and is when pregnancy begins. If the fertilized egg continues to grow, it becomes an embryo and then a fetus and, finally, a baby at birth. </p>
<p>Most fertilized eggs do not become babies. Up to half of fertilized eggs do not attach to the uterus and leave the body in menstrual flow. Some implant, but their development ends in fewer than 20 weeks. <b>This is called miscarriage or spontaneous abortion.</b></p> 
<p>Sometimes women decide to end their pregnancies through a procedure called induced abortion. Sometimes a fetus dies after 20 weeks or just before or during birth. This is called a stillbirth. </p>
<P>
Usually the first sign of pregnancy is a missed period. Other signs are <b>nausea or vomiting, having sore and swollen breasts, fatigue, and increased urination.</b> </P>
<p>Women who suspect they might be pregnant should take a pregnancy test or see their health care provider. 
It is important that pregnant women get prenatal care as soon as possible. </p>
