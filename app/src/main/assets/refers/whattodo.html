<h5><b>I’m pregnant — what do I do now?</b></h5>
<br>
<p>Finding out you’re pregnant can be scary, but try to stay calm.</p>
<p> You’re going to be okay, and there are people who can help you.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you’re pregnant you have 3 options:</li>
<li><b>Parenting</b> — giving birth and raising the child.</li>
<li><b>Abortion</b> —   ending the pregnancy.</li>
<li><b>Adoption</b> —   giving birth and giving the child to someone else, forever.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you think you might choose parenting or adoption, you need prenatal care to make sure you stay healthy during the pregnancy.</p>
<p> If you’re thinking about getting an abortion visit a health facility as soon as possible.</p>
<p> Abortion is safe when done correctly with a qualified health practitioner and in an equipped hospital, but there are more risks the longer you wait.</p>
<p><b>Whatever you decide to do, go to a known health facility right away so they can help you stay healthy.</b></p>

<p>You can also get information and health care from other family planning centers or comprehensive care clinics.</p>
<p> Be careful when looking for a reliable health center — there are fake clinics.</p>

<p><b>Talking with someone about your feelings can be helpful, too. If you can, it’s a really good idea to talk with your parents about it — chances are they care about you and want to help you.</p>
<p>You could also talk with another family member, boyfriend/girlfriend, friend, school counselor, religious advisor, or another adult that you trust. Choose someone who will listen to you, be supportive, respect your privacy, and won’t be judgmental or try to pressure you into anything.</p></b>
<ul>
<li><p>If you’re having a hard time finding someone in your life to talk with, Contact our online counselor through our talk to a counselor button.</p><p>
  You can also call 1190 hotline number  where you can talk about your pregnancy and get support, no matter how you’re feeling.</p></li>
<li><p>No one should pressure you into making any decision about your pregnancy, no matter what.</p> Only you know what’s right for you.</li>
</ul>

<h5><b>How do I tell my parents that I’m pregnant?</b></h5>
<ul>
<li>	Even though it might feel scary, talking with your parents can really help. They can talk through your options with you, and make sure you get the health care you need.</li>
<li><p>	Many people worry that their parents will freak out, but that’s not always what happens.</p>
<p> If you can, try to be open and honest. Start by telling your parents that you trust them and need their help and support.</p>
<p> Most of the time, they just want to make sure you’re healthy and safe. If your parents do get upset, they may just need some time to calm down.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Sometimes parents are shocked or angry, and sometimes they're understanding.</p>
<p> There’s really no way to know how your parents will feel unless you talk with them about it.</p>
<P> It might help to find a time when you can talk in private and there are no distractions.</P>
<P> If you’re feeling really nervous or scared to talk to your parents, you can always ask a friend or other family member to be there with you during the conversation. That way, you’ll have support no matter what happens.</P></li>
<li><p>	If you really feel like you can’t talk to your parents, try talking to another adult who you trust (like an aunt or uncle, grandparent, older sibling, school nurse, or counselor).</p>
<p> If you’re worried that telling your parents you’re pregnant may put you in danger, tell a teacher, nurse or doctor, or other adult you trust.</p></li></ul>
