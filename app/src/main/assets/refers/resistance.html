<h4><b>What is drug resistance?</b></h4>
<p>One of the possible consequences of not taking your HIV treatment properly is that your HIV will develop resistance to anti-HIV drugs.</p>
<p><b>Drug-resistant HIV strains vary</b> â€“ some may be highly resistant to anti-HIV drugs, while others may be less so.</p>
<p> When an anti-HIV drug is started, HIV that is fully susceptible to that drug disappears rapidly and drug-resistant viruses remain.</p>
<p> If the HIV replication is not fully suppressed, these resistant viruses can continue to reproduce themselves despite the drug's presence.</p>
<p>Resistance is an important reason why HIV treatment can fail.</p>
<p> Viral load, which should drop when you start a new drug combination, will increase again if drug-resistant HIV is able to emerge.</p>
<p> However, newer anti-HIV drugs provide treatment options for people who have developed resistance to other drugs and resistance does not need to be a reason for someone to become seriously ill because of HIV.</p>
<h4><b>Take your HIV treatment</b></h4>
<p>Taking your HIV treatment in the correct doses, at the right time, observing any food restrictions and avoiding interactions with other drugs will reduce the risk of resistance developing.</p>
<h4><b>Take the right anti-HIV drugs</b></h4>
<p>Before you start HIV treatment for the first time, or change treatment because your viral load is detectable, you should have a resistance test.</p>
<p>The results of a resistance test will help you and your doctor to choose the combination of drugs that is likely to be most effective against your HIV.</p>
