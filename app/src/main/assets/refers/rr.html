<h4><b>How is (PrEP) different from (PEP)?</b></h4>
<p>
PrEP is not the same as PEP (which stands for Post-Exposure Prophylaxis). While both are taken by HIV-negative people to prevent HIV, PrEP is taken to reduce the risk of getting HIV from the potential exposure that may occur sometime in the future. It should be taken once every day so when a person comes in contact with HIV, his or her body is ready to fight off the virus. PrEP should be taken continuously for as long as a person remains at high risk of HIV (for example, when one’s partner is HIVpositive, or when a person has multiple sex partners). </p>
 
<p>PEP, on the other hand, is taken only after a person might have been exposed to HIV (for example a condom broke or was not used with a partner who is possibly HIVpositive, or a person was raped). PEP has to be started within 3 days after possible</p> 
<p>HIV exposure and involves taking a full treatment dose of ARV drugs two or three times a day for 28 days. Because of the higher dose of ARVs, side effects are more common with PEP than with PrEP, and these side effects are more pronounced. </p>
 
<p>PEP is a good choice for those who may experience rare, accidental exposure to HIV, while PrEP is a good choice for people who have an ongoing high risk of HIV exposure.</p>

<h4><b>Pre- vs Postexposure Prophylaxis</b></h4> 
<ul>
<li>After exposure to HIV, infection may become established </li>
<li>Postexposure prophylaxis
(initiated soon after exposure) reduces the chance of infection</li>
<li>Pre-exposure prophylaxis begins treatment earlier (before exposure)</li>
