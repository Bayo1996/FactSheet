   <h3><b>Nutritional education</b></h3>

    <h4><b>Here are some tips:</b></h4>
    <ul>
    <li>Eat something yellow (like PUMKIN or CARROT), something red (like BEETROOT or TOMATOS) and something green (like SPINICH) every day.</li>

    <li>Eat SAYO or EGGS, BEANS, LENTILS, instead of meat. If you do eat meat, cook it well. Beans are just as good as meat if you put a tablespoon of uncooked sunflower oil with it before serving.</li>
     <li><b style="color: red">Avoid pork</b></li>
     <li>Drink ATLEAST eight glasses of water everyday</li>
    </ul>
   The following should be taken daily <b>IF POSSIBLE:</b><br>
    1. <b>1</b> Glass of lemon juice<br>
    2. <b>1</b>Tablespoon of fresh garlic<br>
    3. <b>1</b> Teaspoon of ginger (not raw)<br>
    4. <b>1</b> Tablespoon of pumpkin seeds<br>
    5. <b>5</b> Tablespoons of ProNutro<br>
    6. <b>6</b> Tablespoons of sour milk or yoghurt<br><br>
    <p>If you get a cold, <b>increase the amount of garlic to at least 5 tablespoons a day.</b> Remember you can also steam with garlic for sinuses or gargle with it for a sore throat.</p>
    <p>Avoid sugar and cool drinks with sugar. Drink unsweetened fruit juices. Avoid peanuts and peanut butter.</p>
    <p>Multi-vitamin supplements are very good for people with HIV and AIDS. Just one multi= vitamin pill a day can help build the immune system. Unfortunately, vitamins are quite expensive to buy. They may be cheaper in bulk and the group members might consider all contributing some money for this.</p>

    <p>it is also very important to clean and cook food properly and to drink only clean water.</p>
    <h4 style="color: red">Bad foods</h4>
    <ul>
    <li>Sugar is very bad for the immune system and causes stomach problems</li>
    <li>Fried foods and cooked oils stop the stomach from being able to digest food</li>
    <li>Spicy food can also cause stomach upsets â€“ do not eat too much</li>
    </ul>
