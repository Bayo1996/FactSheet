<h4><b>The flu vaccine</b></h4>
<p>Vaccines against flu viruses have been available for many years.</p>
<p> Because flu viruses are so susceptible to change, the make-up of the vaccine is reviewed each year to include the most prevalent strains.</p>
<p>It is recommended that people in high-risk groups, including people with HIV, be vaccinated.</p>
<p> The vaccine only provides protection for about a year, so it is important you are revaccinated each year.</p>
<p>The seasonal flu vaccine doesn’t have <b>‘live’</b> virus in it, so it is safe for use in people with HIV.</p> The vaccine is effective in people with HIV , although there is some evidence that people with low CD4 counts are less likely to be protected by it (however, <b>it may reduce the risk of complications</b>).</p>
