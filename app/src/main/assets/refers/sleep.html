<p>Not getting enough sleep can cause health problems, but there are a number of practical things you can do to sleep better and in some cases medicines may help.</p>

<h4><b>Why do we need to sleep?</b></h4>
<p>Sleep is essential to both physical and mental health.</p>
<p> Sleep allows the body and mind to rest and recover.</p>
<p> Long-term sleep deprivation can cause emotional problems such as <b>depression</b>.</p>
<p><b>Lack of, or poor</b>, sleep can also put you at risk of medical conditions such as<b> heart disease ,obesity and type 2 diabetes</b> .</p>
<p> It is thought that long-term sleep problems can mean that the immune system doesn’t work properly, meaning that a person may be more likely to get ill.</p>

<h4><b>Structure of sleep</b></h4>
<p>Sleep follows a pattern, alternating between <b>REM (rapid-eye-movement) sleep and non-REM sleep</b>.</p>
<p> In the course of a night, the body goes through cycles of REM and non-REM sleep.</p>
<p> Five or six cycles of this pattern are needed for a good night’s sleep.</p>

<h4><b>How much sleep is needed</b></h4>
<p>People’s sleep needs vary but most adults need between six and nine hours each night.</p>
<p> If you have been working or exercising very hard, are ill, or recovering from an illness or infection, you may find that the amount of sleep you need increases substantially.</p>
<p>Getting enough sleep is important but it’s also important not to oversleep.</p>
<p> Sleeping too much can reduce motivation and make you feel tired.</p>

<h4><b>Insomnia</b></h4>
<p>Not being able to sleep is called <b>insomnia </b>.</p>
<p> It can take many forms. Some people find it difficult to fall asleep; others wake up after just a few hours of sleep and then can’t get back to sleep;</p>
<p> some people wake up very early in the morning; and others find that their sleep does not leave them feeling refreshed.</p>
<p><b>Causes of insomnia</b></p>
<p>For many people, <b>worry or stress</b> is the cause of their sleeplessness.</p>
<p> Once a problem has resolved, then sleep patterns become better.</p>
<p> However, more serious problems like anxiety and depression can cause sleep problems which last for very long periods.</p>
<p> Symptoms of illnesses, such as night sweats, and pain can also interfere with sleep.</p>
<p> It's a good idea to report these problems to your doctor.</p>

<h4><b>Managing sleep problems</b></h4>
<p>In many cases, a few lifestyle changes are enough to bring back good sleep.</p>
<p> These might include <b>avoiding tea and coffee and other stimulants</b> for several hours before going to bed, or <b>not napping</b> during the day.</p>
<p>Keeping regular sleeping hours may help, if possible, so your body can get into a routine.</p>
<p> Not going to bed until you are feeling ready to sleep may also help.</p>
<p> If you cannot get to sleep after <b>about 30 minutes</b>, get up rather than tossing and turning and getting frustrated, which often makes the problem worse.</p>

<p><b>Keeping a record of your sleep</b>, known as a sleep diary, might be useful.</p>
<p>If you are finding it difficult to get to sleep, you could try these ideas to get you ready for bed:</p>
<ol>
<li>Have a warm bath.</li>
<li><p>Have a warm drink, such as camomile tea or milk.</p>
  <p>But try to avoid caffeinated drinks for three to four hours before going to bed.</p></li>
<li><p>If stress or worry is keeping you awake, getting your thoughts down on paper may help.</p>
<p> Create a to-do list of your tasks for the next day if you find you are thinking about them when you are trying to get to sleep.</p></li>
<li><p>Try relaxation or breathing exercises.</p><p> Some people find that some aromatherapy oils help them to relax.</p></li>
<li>Read a book or listen to an audio-book or some relaxing music.</li>
<li>Try not to watch TV or use phones, computers or electronic gadgets in bed.</li>
</ol>
