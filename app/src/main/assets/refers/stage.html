<h4><b>Primary infection –stage one</b></h4> 
<p>The stage of infection lasts for few weeks and is often accompanied by short flu like illness, which occurs just after infection.</p>
<p> In up to 20% of the people the symptoms are serious enough to consult a doctor, but the diagnosis is frequently missed.</p><p> Even if HIV antibody test is done at this time, it may not yet be positive. </p>

<p>During this stage there is large amount of HIV in the blood and the immune system begins to respond to the virus by producing antibodies. </p>

<h4><b>Clinically asymptomatic stage- stage two</b></h4>
<p>The stage last for an average of ten years and is free from any symptoms, although there may be swollen glands.</p>
<p> The level of HIV in the blood drops to very low levels but people remain infectious and HIV antibodies are detectable in the blood.</p> 
<p>Recent research has shown that HIV is not dormant during this stage, but is very active in the lymph nodes.</p>
<p> Many <b>T helper cells</b> are infected and die, and a large amount of the virus is produced. </p>
<p>A new test is now available to measure the small amount of HIV that escapes the lymph nodes.</p> 
 <p>This test, which measure HIV RNA [HIV genetic material] is referred to as the viral load test and it has an increasingly important role in the treatment of HIV infection.</p>

<h4><b>Symptomatic HIV infection -stage three </b></h4>
<p>Over time the immune system loses the struggle to contain HIV.</p>
<p> This is for three main reasons:</p>
<ol> 
<li>The lymph nodes and the tissues become damaged or ‘burnt out’ because of years of activity. </li>
<li>HIV mutates (changes) and become more pathogenic, in other words stronger and more varied leading to more T helper cell destruction. </li>
<li>The body fails to keep up with replacing the T helper cells that are lost. </li>
</ol>

<p>As the immune system fails, so symptoms develop.</p>
<p> Initially many of the symptoms are mild, but as the immune system deteriorates, the symptoms worsen. </p>

<h4><b>Progression from HIV to AIDS -stage  four </b></h4>
<p>As the immune system becomes more and more damaged, illnesses become more and more severe, leading eventually to an AIDS diagnosis.</p> 
 <p>At present an AIDS diagnosis is confirmed if a person with HIV develops one or more of a specific number of severe opportunistic infections or cancers.</p>
 <p> However, people can still be very ill with HIV but not have an AIDS diagnosis.  </p>

<h4><b>Delaying AIDS</b></h4>
<ol>
<li>HIV-positive people who pay attention to their nutrition needs and eat a balanced diet develop AIDS later and die later than those who are <b>malnourished</b>.</li> 
<li>An HIV person, may get information on nutrition from many sources, talk to others living successfully with HIV, and consult a doctor before deciding what is the best diet or medication for him or her. </li>
<li>As the body grows weaker and weaker, at sometime it will lose the power to be able to fight other disease and sickness. This is when you start to feel and look very sick. The stage is called <b>AIDS (short for Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome)</b></li>
<li><p>As a person’s immune system begins to weaken because of HIV infection, that person begins acquiring infections that he or she might have otherwise resisted.</p>
<p> These infections are called <b>opportunistic infections.</b></p></li>
</ol>
