<p>During <b>breastfeeding</b>, HIV can be transmitted from an HIV-positive mother to her baby.
In the UK and other countries where safe alternatives are available, it is recommended that HIV-positive women do not breastfeed their babies.</p>
<p>If an HIV-positive woman decides to breastfeed, it is then safer to do so exclusively, and the risk of transmission is reduced if she and the child are on antiretroviral treatment.
The first evidence that HIV could be transmitted via breast milk was a case report of the child of a previously healthy woman who was delivered by <b>caesarean section</b>.
<p> Because of blood loss from the operation, the mother was given a blood transfusion after the delivery. The baby was breastfed for six weeks. Later, it was discovered that a unit of the transfused blood had been contaminated with HIV. The mother and her infant were subsequently found to have both become infected.</p>
<p>Moreover, HIV transmission after childbirth (in medical language, <b>‘postpartum’</b>) is known to occur because some infants test negative for HIV RNA one month after birth, but test positive later on.</p>
<p>HIV can be detected in breast milk. Three HIV reservoirs coexist in breast milk:</p>
<ol><li><b> RNA</b> (cell-free viral particles)</li>
<li><b> proviral DNA</b> (cell-associated virus integrated in latent T-cells)</li>
<li><b> intracellular RNA</b> (cell-associated virus in activated producing T-cells).</li>
</ol><p> The respective role of each in HIV transmission is poorly understood.</p>

<p>Moreover, if the nipples are <b>cracked or bleeding</b>, blood may transmit the virus too.</p>
