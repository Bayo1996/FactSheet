<p>If you have been diagnosed with HIV, it is only natural to want to know what effect the virus will have on your health in the future and your life-expectancy.</p>
<p>The word used to forecast the likely course of a disease is <b>'prognosis'</b>.</p>
<p> It comes from an ancient Greek word that means ‘to know beforehand’.</p>

<h4><b>Factors affecting the prognosis of people with HIV</b></h4>
<p>The following factors affect the life-expectancy of people living with HIV:</p>
<ol>
<li><b>CD4 cell count.</b> This gives a rough guide to the health of the immune system.</li>
<li><b>Viral load.</b> The amount of HIV in the blood.</li>
<li><b>Age.</b></li>
<li>Developing serious illness because of HIV before HIV treatment is started.</li>
<li>Infection with <b>hepatitis B virus or hepatitis C virus</b> .</li>
<li>Injecting drug use.</li>
<li>Smoking .</li>
</ol>
<h4><b>Why is prognosis improving?</b></h4>
<p>The simple answer is that potent HIV treatment became available.</p>
<p> The amount of illness and death caused by HIV has fallen dramatically since powerful combinations of anti-HIV drugs became available in 1996.</p>
<p>Doctors have also become skilled at treating the infections that people living with HIV can be vulnerable to when CD4 counts are low.</p>
<h4><b>Looking after your health</b></h4>
<p>There is a lot you can do to look after your health and to give yourself the best chance of living a long and healthy life.</p>
<p><b>This includes:</b></p>
<ol>
<li>Making sure that you go to your HIV clinic for regular check-ups .</li>
<li>Taking your HIV medication and any other treatment properly .</li>
<li>Avoiding infection with hepatitis B or hepatitis C .</li>
<li>Not smoking .</li>
<li>Eating a good, balanced diet.</li>
<li>Exercising regularly.</li>
<li>Looking after your mental health .</li>
<li>Finding support</li>
</ol>
