<p>The AMPATH Research Network, currently led by <b>Dr. Rachel Vreeman of Indiana University and Dr. Winstone Nyandiko of Moi University</b>, was born in 1998. </p>
<p> The research program was built on a solid foundation with an eye toward sustainability. The efforts to create a sustainable program included establishing:</p>
<ul>
<li>A research program office at  <b>AMPATH</b> to oversee and coordinate research activities.</li>
<li>A Research and Sponsored Programs office to provide grants managements and other essential services.</li>
<li>An Institutional Review Board to ensure that proposed research is both ethical and culturally-appropriate.</li>
<li>An ISO certified laboratory with enhanced capacity to support research projects.</li>
</ul>
<p>This infrastructure has allowed the program to grow from a single research project to more than 90 active projects with research funding in excess of $83.4 million.</p>
<p>  Our research projects have included collaborators from more than 19 universities and academic institutions in Africa, Europe, and North America.  Over 275 publications have resulted from these collaborations.</p>
<p>The program structure has been adapted over the years to deal with its growth.  Initially, there was one full-time IU researcher working and living in Kenya.</p>
<p>
  Now, there are 5 co-field directors for Research; three are full-time in Kenya.  To facilitate collaboration, the program is organized into 9 research working groups<b> (adult medicine, basic science,  behavioral & social science, cardiovascular and pulmonary disease, oncology, pediatrics,  public health & primary care, reproductive health, and tuberculosis)</b> and 7 cores <b>(operations, data management, biostatistics, clinical informatics, pharmacy, laboratory, and bioethics).</b></p><p>  Additionally, each project must have both a North American and Kenyan principal investigator.</p>
