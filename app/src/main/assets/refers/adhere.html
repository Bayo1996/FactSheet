<h4><b> After you start an HIV regimen, use a variety of strategies to maintain adherence.</b></h4>
  <p>To maintain adherence over the long term, try some of the following strategies: 
  <ol> 
  <li>Use a 7-day pill box. Once a week, fill the pill box with your HIV medicines for the entire week.</li> 
  <li>Take your HIV medicines at the same time every day.</li> 
  <li>Set the alarm on your cell phone to remind you to take your medicines. (An alarm clock or timer works too.)to bookmark your HIV medicines, make notes, and set daily pill reminders.</li> 
  <li>Ask your family members, friends, or coworkers to remind you to take your medicines.</li> 
  <li>Keep your medicines nearby. Keep a back-up supply of medicines at work or in your purse or briefcase.</li> 
  <li>Plan ahead for changes in your daily routine, including weekends and holidays. If you&rsquo;re going away, pack enough medicine to last the entire trip.</li> 
  <li>Use an app or an online or paper medicine diary to stay on track. Enter the name of each medicine; include the dose, number of pills to take, and when to take them. Record each medicine as you take it. Reviewing your diary will help you identify the times that you&rsquo;re most likely to forget to take your medicines.</li> 
  <li>Keep all of your medical appointments. Use a calendar to keep track of your appointments. If you run low on medicines before your next appointment, call your health care provider to renew your prescriptions.</li> 
  <li>Get additional tips on adherence by joining a support group for people living with HIV.</li>
