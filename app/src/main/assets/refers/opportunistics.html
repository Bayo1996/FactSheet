         <ul>
         <li>Best ways to <b>prevent</b> getting an OI are to get into and stay on medical care and to take HIV medications as prescribed.</li>
         <li>Sometimes, your health care provider will also prescribe medications specifically to prevent certain OIs.</li>
          </ul>
         <p>By <b>staying on HIV medications,</b> you can keep the amount of HIV in your body as low as possible and keep your immune system healthy. It is especially important that you get regular check-ups and take all of your medications as prescribed by your care giver.</p>
        <p><b>The best ways</b> to prevent getting an OI are to get into and stay on medical care and to take HIV medications as prescribed. Sometimes, your health care provider will also prescribe medications specifically to prevent certain OIs.
        </p> <p>By <b>staying on HIV medications</b>, you can keep the amount of HIV in your body as low as possible and keep your immune system healthy.</p> 
        <p>It is especially important that you get<b> regular check-ups </b>and take all of your medications as prescribed by your care giver. <b>Taking HIV medications is a life-long commitment.</b></p>
       <p>In addition to taking HIV medications to <b>keep your immune system strong</b>, there are other steps you can take to prevent g etting an OI.:-
        <ol> 
         <li><b>USE CONDOM consistently and correctly to prevent exposure to sexually transmitted infections.</b></li>
         <li><b>DON'T</b> share drug injection equipment. <b>Blood with hepatitis C </b> in it can remain in syringes and needles after use and the infection can be transmitted to the next user.</li>
          <li><b>GET VACCINATED</b> – your doctor can tell you what vaccines you need. If he or she doesn’t, you should ask.</li>
         <li><b> Understand what GERMS </b>you are exposed to <b>(such as tuberculosis or germs found in the stools, saliva, or on the skin of animals)</b> and limit your exposure to them.</li>
         <li><b>DON'T consume </b>certain foods, including undercooked eggs, unpasteurized (raw) milk and cheeses, unpasteurized fruit juices, or raw seed sprouts.</li>
         <li><b>DON'T drink untreated water</b> such as water directly from lakes or rivers. Tap water in foreign places is also often not safe. Use bottled water or water filters.</li></b>
        </ol>
       </p>
         <p>If you do develop an OI, <b>there are treatments available,</b> such as<b> antibiotics or antifungal drugs.</b> Having an OI may be a very serious medical situation and its treatment can be challenging.
         The development of an OI likely means that your immune system is weakened and that your HIV is not under control. That is why it is so important to be on medication, take it as prescribed, <b>see your care provider regularly, and undergo the routine monitoring</b> he or she recommends to ensure your viral load is reduced and your immune system is healthy.</p>

            Mycobacterium tuberculosis.</b> TB can be spread through the air when a person with active TB coughs, sneezes, or speaks. Breathing in the bacteria can lead to infection in the lungs. Symptoms of TB in the lungs include cough, tiredness, weight loss, fever, and night sweats. Although the disease usually occurs in the lungs, it may also affect other parts of the body, most often the larynx, lymph nodes, brain, kidneys, or bones.</td>

PCP occurs in people with weakened immune systems, including people with HIV. The first signs of infection are <b>difficulty breathing, high fever, and dry cough.</b>
             Pneumonia, <b>recurrent Pneumonia</b> is an infection in one or both of the lungs. Many germs, including bacteria, viruses, and fungi can cause pneumonia, with symptoms such as a cough (with mucous), fever, chills, and trouble breathing. In people with immune systems severely damaged by HIV, one of the most common and life-threatening causes of pneumonia is infection with the bacteria <b style="color: red;">Streptococcus pneumoniae, also called Pneumococcus</b> . There are now effective vaccines that can prevent infection with Streptococcus pneumoniae and all persons with <b>HIV infection should be vaccinated.</b>
