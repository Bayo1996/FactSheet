<h4><b>Definitions</b></h4>
<h4><b>What is Adolescence?</b></h4>
<p>Adolescence is the time between childhood and adulthood. It is the period during which a young person develops from a child into an adult. We usually consider adolescence between ages 10 to 19 years. This is a time that is marked by growth and change. Adolescents have changes in their bodies, in their thinking, and in their emotions.</p>
<h4><b>What is Puberty?</b></h4>
<p>The changes that occur in your body during adolescence are called puberty. Puberty means that your body is becoming a mature adult body. Having a mature adult body means that your body grows, your body begins to look like an adult body, and your body becomes capable of being pregnant or fathering a child.</p>
<h4><b>How do I go through this stage successfully?</b></h4>
<p><ol>
<li>Accept the stage. Being an adolescent is a normal part of becoming an adult. </li>
<li>Accept your bodyâ€™s changes. The changes in your body show that your body is healthy and strong.</li>
<li> Try to enjoy the journey of growing into an adult and having your opinions change Share any information, questions or disturbing issues with a trusted person</li>
<li> Be active and engage in healthy activities Seek and ask for advice from trusted sources such as a counselor, a parent, or a teacher</li>
<li> Being healthy means eating good foods, exercising your body, and taking medicines that your doctor has recommended for you.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<h4><b>Physical Changes </b></h4>
<p>The changes in your body are caused by changes in the amounts of hormones that your body produces. This can make your body have increased odors, increased sweat, and other discharge. Girls also begin to have menstruation. For both girls and boys, it is especially important to maintain proper hygiene throughout puberty. Remember to wash your body daily</p>

<h4><b>Social Changes</b></h4>
<p>During adolescence, you may find that your relationships with your peers begin to change. You may
<ul>
<li>Start to become attracted to a friend of the opposite sex</li>
<li> Act shy towards this person or find it difficult to talk to them</li>
<li>Become interested in different hobbies or sports</li>
<li>Spend time with different groups of friends</li>
<li> Some of your friends or peers may start to change</li>
</ul></p>
<h4><b>What do I do if my friends are engaging in risky behaviors?</b></h4>
<p>Sometimes, your friends may start to do things that may harm themselves or others. They might want to have sex without protection or drink alcohol. These friends may try to pressure you into doing the same risky behaviors. It is up to you to decide where your morals lie and how you will interact with these friends. You can ask yourself: Do these friends care about my future? Do these friends value the same morals that I value?</p>
<h4><b>What do I do if I realize that my friends are talking about me? </b></h4>
<p>You cannot control what people say or think about you. Remember that you are in control of your own emotional reactions and how you treat people.</p>
<h4><b>During adolescence your relationships with your family may change.</b></h4>
<p><ul><li>As you get older, your parents may expect you to have more responsibilities.</li>
<li> You may desire more independence from your parents or guardians and your siblings.</li>
<li> You may not enjoy the games you used to love to play with your younger siblings.</li>
<li> You may not want to spend time with your family as you used to</li>
</ul></p>
<h4><b>Support Network </b></h4>
<p>No matter what your situation is, it is good to have a social support system. Many people find that talking with certain people in their lives helps them to digest information or to handle stressful situations. The people in your life that you view as supportive and helpful are called your support system. It is helpful to identify some key people in your personal support system. During adolescence, your support system may change as your peers are also growing into new people. Even as you change and grow, you can find people you trust with information, ideas, and secrets. These people may be parents, caregivers, brother or sisters, close friends, grandparents or others who are close to you.</p>
