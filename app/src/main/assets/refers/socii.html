<h4><b>HOW IS THE TEST USED?</b></h4>
 <h6><b>The test is helpful in several areas:
</b></h6>
<p><ul>
<li>For medical researchers, the test proved that HIV is never “latent” but is always multiplying. Many people with no symptoms of AIDS and high CD4 cell counts also had high viral loads. If the virus was latent, the test wouldn’t have found any HIV in the blood.</li>
<li>
The test can be used for diagnosis , because it can detect a viral load a few days after HIV infection. This is better than the standard HIV (antibody) test, which can be “negative” for 2 to 6 months after HIV infection. ( Fact Sheet 102 has more information on HIV antibody testing. )</li>

<li>For prognosis , For prognosis, viral load can help predict how fast HIV disease progresses without treatment. The higher the viral load, the faster the disease progression.</li>
<li>
For prevention, viral load predicts how easy it is to transmit HIV to someone else. The higher the viral load, the higher the risk of transmitting HIV.</li>
<li>For managing therapy , the test shows treatment is controlling the virus. Current guidelines ( Fact Sheet 404 ) suggest measuring baseline (pre-treatment) viral load. Treatment is “working” if it lowers viral load by at least 90% within 8 weeks. The viral load should continue to drop to less than 50 copies within 6 months. The viral load should be measured within 2 to 8 weeks after treatment is started or changed. It should be monitored every 6 months after that for patients with good adherence who have an undetectable viral load and have been clinically stable on their treatment for 2 or 3 years. According to the guidelines, treatment failure is indicated by a confirmed viral load above 200 copies while adherent to treatment.</li>
