<p><b>Male and female condoms</b> provide excellent protection against HIV and most other sexually transmitted infections.</p>
<p> To be effective, they need to be used correctly.</p>
<p>Where possible, choose a condom with a quality kitemark.</p>
<p> Don’t use old condoms or ones that have been left in direct sunlight for any length of time.</p>
<p>Don’t flush used condoms down the toilet, as this can cause blockages in the sewerage system.</p>
<h4><b>Male condoms</b></h4>
<p>Most male condoms are made of latex, a form of rubber. Some people are allergic to latex, and polyurethane (<b>a type of plastic</b>) condoms are a safe alternative.</p>
<p>Male condoms come in a range of <b>shapes, sizes, thicknesses, flavours, textures and colours</b>.</p> 
<p>Male condoms are commonly sold in chemists, garages and supermarkets, and from vending machines.</p>
<p> In some cities, gay venues provide free condoms. HIV clinics and sexual health clinics provide free condoms, as do contraception clinics.</p>
<p><b>Using a male condom correctly:</b></p>
<ol>
<li>Condoms come in a plastic or foil wrapper. When opening the wrapper be careful not to tear the condom.</li>
<li>Put the condom on once your penis is hard, but before penetration begins.</li>
<li><p>Condoms come with a teat or a plain end.</p>
<p> In either case, it is important to allow enough room for the semen to be able to fill the end of the condom.</p><p> Make sure there is no air in the condom, by holding the teat or end between your thumb and forefinger as you roll the condom on.</p>
<p> If you leave air in the end of the condom, it may break when you ejaculate into it. Unroll the condom all the way down the shaft of the penis.</p></li>


<li>If you lose your erection, the condom may slip. This is the biggest single cause of condom failure. Holding the base of the condom will help it stay in place.</li>
<li>If the condom slips or breaks, withdraw immediately and use a new one.</li>
<li>After ejaculating, withdraw the penis promptly, before it goes soft. Hold on to the base of the condom as you withdraw.</li>
<li>Never re-use condoms.</li>
<li>If you are having penetrative sex for a long time, the risk of the condom breaking increases. <b>It is safest to change the condom every 30 minutes</b>.</li>
</ol>

<h4><b>Female condoms</b></h4>
<p>The female condom is a plastic pouch that you insert before sex. It is usually made of polyurethane, nitrile rubber or latex.</p>
<p>The female condom has two flexible rings: the ring at the closed end holds it in place in the vagina. The ring at the open end should remain outside the vagina during sex.</p>
<p>Sexual health clinics and HIV clinics provide female condoms for free, although they are not as widely available as male condoms.</p>
<p> You can also buy them from some chemists or from websites.</p>
<p>Some women prefer the female condom because they can be in control of both contraception and protecting themselves and their partner from HIV. You can put a female condom in several hours before having sex.</p>
<p> Some people also prefer them because of their thinness and sensitivity, which can improve sensation.</p>

<p><b>Using a female condom correctly:</b></p>
<ol>
<li>To insert it, find a comfortable position. You can stand with one foot on a chair, sit on the edge of a chair or bath, lie down, or squat.</li>
<li>Squeeze together the sides of the inner ring at the closed end of the female condom and insert it into the vagina like a tampon.</li>
<li>Putting a finger inside the female condom, push the inner ring into the vagina as far as it can go.</li>
<li>Pull out your finger and let the outer ring stay outside the vagina during sex.</li>
<li>Use your hand to guide your partner’s penis into the female condom (make sure his penis doesn’t slip between the condom and the side of the vagina).</li>
<li>The female condom is loose-fitting and will move during sex. That’s fine as long as the penis stays inside it.</li>
<li>You don’t have to take it out immediately after sex. When you do remove it, squeeze and twist the outer ring to keep semen inside the pouch. Gently pull it out of the vagina.</li>
