       <h4><b>How can I get good friends?</b></h4>
       <p>At times, it is not easy to get good friends, but we have to be keen when we are choosing friends. We should choose friends who have respect, are well-behaved, and are mindful about our well-being.</p>
        <h6><b>Read the story and answer the questions:</b></h6>
       <p><i>Peter had two friends when he started school. One was called Tom, and the other called James. Tom liked to play a lot and he did not want to read, he was not respectful to the elderly and did not even help his mother with chores. James, on the other hand, was very hard-working, obedient, respectful and liked to help his mother when she was working at home. Tom would tell Peter to do bad things like to steal mangoes in their neighbor’s shamba. This was not a good thing to do. Peter noticed that Tom was not a good friend, because he was telling him to do bad things. Peter found that James helped him with school and was always giving him good advice.</i></p>
       <h5><b>Discusion</b></h5>
         <ol>
         <li>Who is the better friend, Tom or James?</li>
         <li> What qualities make a good friend?</li>
         <li> What qualities make a bad friend?</li>
         <li> What qualities have you noticed in your friends?</li>
         </ol>
       <h4><b>Friends and secrets</b></h4>
        <p>At times, we would like to share secrets. Friends can keep our secrets and help us through our problems.</p>
       <h6><b>Read the story and answer the questions:</b></h6>
       <p><i>Peter had a big secret that only his parents and his sister knew. He had been told not to share with other people because they would say bad things to him that could hurt him. Over time, Peter struggled with some issues related to the big secret. He felt the need to share with James, who was one of his very good friends. One day, Peter shared with James the big secret. He did not know how he would respond, but James stood out to be a great support for Peter.</i> </p>

      <h5><b>Discusion</b></h5>
       <ol>
       	<li>What makes you trust a friend?</li>
       	<li>Can you think of a time when you told a friend a secret?</li>
       	<li>Why do we tell friends our secrets?</li>
       </ol>
       <h4><b>Relationships with parents/ Caregivers</b></h4>
       <h6><b>Why is it difficult to be friends with my parents?</b></h6>
       <p>Good relationships with your caregivers are very important. At times, the relationship can be affected when you disagree on:
           <b><ul>
           	<li>way of dressing</li>
           	<li>the friends you have how you</li>
           	<li>perform in your studies</li>
           	<li>how you are taking your medication</li>
           </ul></b>
         More often your parents/guardians have your best interests in mind, and they want you to obey them in order for you not to get into problems. Shouting back when you disagree with them or insulting them only worsens the situation.</p>
       <h5><b>What can I do to improve my relationship with my parents?</b></h5>
       <p>Communicating with kindness and respecting your parents will enhance your relationship.  However hard your parents push your buttons, remember that responding calmly and with self restraint will show them they can trust you and that you are growing into an adult.  It can be difficult for parents to adjust to their children growing older and needing independence from their guidance and control.</p>

       <h4><b>What is a Relationship?</b></h4>
       <p><b>A relationship</b> is a connection between two or more people. There are many different types of relationships. Relationships can involve friends, peers, parents and other family members, and boyfriends/girlfriends.  
     </p>
       <h4><b>Relationships with friends</b></h4>
       <p>A friend is someone very close to you, who you can trust to tell about yourself.  We can always look up to them for good advice and support when in need. A good friend may have the following qualities: 
       <ul>
       <li><b>Trustworthy:</b> can keep secrets</li> 
       <li><b>Honest:</b> don’t lie to you or others</li>
       <li><b> Accepting:</b> won’t judge you if you have a different opinion than them Supportive: will be there for you during rough times</li>
       <li><b> Forgiving:</b> will forgive you if you do something bad </li>
       </ul>
      </p>
